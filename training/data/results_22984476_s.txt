Cis-acting Consensus Recognized by AphA

The AphA orthologs from nine Vibrio species (V. parahaemolyticus, Vibrio sp. Ex25, Vibrio sp. EJY3, V. harveyi, V. vulnificus, V. splendidus, V. anguillarum, V. cholerae, and V. furnissii) with determined whole genome sequences gave high identity ( GTEQ 84%) among each other in the a.a. sequences.
A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) was constructed from the aligned a.a. sequences of the above nine orthologous AphA proteins, with an additional AphA homologue from Photobacterium profundum SS9 [25] as the outgroup (this protein has about 66 to 70% identity to the above nine AphA orthologs).
Three clades I, II, and III were arbitrarily identified for the nine Vibrio species on the basis of phylogenetic tree.

Since the nine AphA orthologs are highly conserved, when they act as the DNA-binding regulatory proteins, they will recognize conserved cis-acting DNA signals in the relevant vibrios.
Known or predicted binding sites of the nine AphA orthologs were collected (Table 2), and then aligned to generate an AphA consensus that manifested as a PFM (in which each row and column represents a position and a nucleotide, respectively) and as a 20 bp box sequence ATATGCAN6TGCATAT that contained imperfect inverted repeats of ATATGCA with a 6-nt centered spacer (Fig. 3).

The presence of AphA box-like sequences within the promoter-proximal DNA regions of aphA, qrr4, and opaR in V. parahaemolyticus (Table 2) indicated that these QS regulators-encoding genes might be the direct AphA targets in V. parahaemolyticus, which were further validated by the following gene regulation experiments.



Growth of WT and DeltaahpA

The growth curves of WT and DeltaaphA grown at 30 degrees C in MR broth were determined (Fig. 4).
DeltaaphA grew slightly slower than WT from time of inoculation to mid-exponential growth phase; however, from mid-exponential phase to enter stationary phase, the two strains showed almost indistinguishable growth rates.
These results indicated that the aphA mutation had little effect on bacterial in vitro growth when MR broth was used for cultivation.



Cell Density-dependent Expression of aphA

The mRNA levels of aphA were measured in WT grown at various OD600 values (i.e. at different cell densities) by the primer extension assay (Fig. 5).
The primer extension experiments detected a single transcription start site located at 200 bp upstream of aphA.
Therefore, a single promoter was transcribed for aphA under the growth conditions tested.
The aphA mRNA levels decreased dramatically with the increasing of cell density, and almost no aphA mRNA could be detected at HCD (OD600 GTEQ 1.16), which supported the model (as described Fig. 1) of cell density-dependent regulation of aphA.

For the following gene regulation experiments, bacteria cells were harvested at an OD600 value of 0.1 to 0.15 to simulate LCD conditions at which aphA was abundantly transcribed.



Negative Auto-regulation of AphA

An aphA::lacZ fusion vector, containing a 531 bp promoter-proximal region of aphA and the promoterless lacZ, was transformed into WT or DeltaaphA to compare the aphA promoter activities in these two strains (Fig. 6a).
The LacZ fusion experiments disclosed that the aphA promoter activity significantly enhanced in DeltaaphA relative to WT.
The primer extension experiments (Fig. 6b) further disclosed that the mRNA level of aphA enhanced in DeltaaphA relative to WT.
A 220 bp promoter-proximal DNA region of aphA was subjected to EMSA with purified His-AphA protein (Fig. 6c).
The results showed that His-AphA was able to bind to the target DNA fragment in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.
As further determined by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 6d), His-AphA protected a single region from 242 to 210 bp upstream of aphA against DNase I digestion in a dose-dependent manner.
This footprint contained a predicted AphA box-like sequence, and was considered as the AphA-binding site for aphA.
Taken together, the AphA regulator was able to recognize the promoter of its own gene to directly repress its activity in V. parahaemolyticus.



Repression of opaR by AphA

An opaR::lacZ fusion vector, containing a 666 bp promoter-proximal region of opaR and the promoterless lacZ, was transformed into both WT and DeltaaphA to compare the opaR promoter activities in these two strains (Fig. 7a).
The LacZ fusion experiments disclosed that the promoter activity of opaR significantly enhanced in DeltaaphA relative to WT.
The primer extension experiments (Fig. 7b) detected a single transcription start site located at 74 bp upstream of opaR, and further disclosed that the mRNA level of opaR enhanced in DeltaaphA relative to WT.
A 334 bp promoter-proximal DNA region of opaR was subjected to EMSA with purified His-AphA protein (Fig. 7c).
The results showed that His-AphA was able to bind to the DNA fragment in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.
As further determined by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 7d), His-AphA protected a single region from 110 to 76 bp upstream of opaR against DNase I digestion in a dose-dependent manner.
This footprint contained a predicted AphA box-like sequence, and was considered as the AphA-binding site for opaR.
Taken together, AphA was able to recognize the promoter of opaR to directly repress its activity in V. parahaemolyticus.



Repression of qrr2-4 by AphA

The LacZ fusion vector for each of qrr2-4 was transformed into WT or DeltaaphA, respectively, to compare the promoter activities of each qrr gene in the two strains (Fig. 8a1, 8b1, and 8c1).
The results showed that the promoter activity of each of qrr2-4 significantly enhanced in DeltaaphA relative to WT.
The primer extension experiments were then conducted to compare the yields of primer extension product of each of qrr2-4 in WT and DeltaaphA (Fig. 8a2, 8b2, and 8c2, respectively).
The primer extension assay defined the transcription start sites for all of qrr2-4, and this assay also indicated that the mRNA level of each of qrr2-4 enhanced in DeltaaphA relative to WT.
Each of the promoter-proximal DNA regions of qrr2-4 was subjected to EMSA with the purified His-AphA protein (Fig. 8a3, 8b3, and 8c3, respectively).
The results showed that His-AphA was able to bind to the DNA fragment of qrr4 rather than qrr2-3.
As further determined by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 8c4), His-AphA protected a single region from 164 to 121 bp upstream of qrr4 against DNase I digestion in a dose-dependent manner.
This footprint contained a predicted AphA box-like sequence, and was considered as the AphA-binding site for qrr4.
Taken together, AphA was able to recognize the promoters of qrr4 to directly repress its activity in V. parahaemolyticus; in contrast, the qrr2-3 genes appeared to be repressed by AphA at the transcriptional level in an indirect manner.
