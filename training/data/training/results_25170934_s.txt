Candidate hrp promoter regions identified by ChIP-Seq

As a direct regulator of the HrpL regulon, the sigma factor HrpL (PSPTO_1404) is required for DC3000 virulence.
To perform a global inventory of genomic sites likely to bind this sigma factor, we tagged HrpL with a FLAG epitope at the C-terminus by modifying the hrpL locus at its native position in DC3000 chromosome (Figure 1A) and performed a ChIP-Seq analysis.
We first confirmed that cells bearing the tagged protein retained the ability to stimulate the hypersensitive response in a plant assay (Figure 1B) and established that HrpL-FLAG retained its ability to support transcription from a known HrpL-responsive promoter (Figure 1C).
Results from a pilot experiment suggested that samples for ChIP-Seq should be harvested at 1.5 hours after a shift from non-inducing to hrp-inducing conditions, given the relatively high abundance of transcripts for hrpL and hopQ1-1, a confirmed effector, at this timepoint (Figures 1D and 1E).

Using the high-resolution ChIP-exo procedure described by Rhee et al.[44] we prepared samples for high-throughput sequencing.
Table 2 summarizes the reads and mapping statistics of the two libraries using data generated by the Illumina Genome Analyzer.
As a control, ChIP-Seq samples for the DeltahrpL strain were prepared using a conventional ChIP-Seq protocol [45] that omits the steps in ChIP-exo that destroy most of unbound DNA [44] (described in Materials and Methods).
The read counts from this sample were compared to those from the HrpL-FLAG sample to determine levels attributable to non-specific binding.

Using the Genetrack [50] analysis package, we identified 73 enriched regions in the DC3000 genome, of which 52 can be associated with one of the 54 annotated hrp promoters (Table S5), and 21 appear in regions without known hrp promoters (Table 3).
The two annotated promoters that were negative with respect to enrichment were PSPTO_1370 (type III effector HopN1) and PSPTO_3489 (a sugar ABC transporter/ATP-binding protein).
Visual inspection of these regions in the ChIP-Seq profile also showed no evidence of enrichment.
Because PSPTO_5633 and PSPTO_B0003 have identical coding and upstream sequences, we counted them as a single enrichment instance, reducing the number of novel regions identified by ChIP-Seq to 20.
Among these promoter candidates, only two are obviously associated with genes that encode proteins involved in the T3SS, namely PSPTO_4721 (type III chaperone ShcV) and PSPTO_5618 (pseudogene for type III effector HopAT1).
The remaining candidates are upstream of genes encoding enzymes, hypothetical proteins or proteins with other functions.

Because of the high resolution afforded by ChIP-exo, we were able to align enriched sequences and identify by inspection a conserved motif that resembles the accepted sequence for the HrpL-responsive promoter, GGAAC( - 35)-N16 - 17-CCACNNA( - 10), particularly in the - 35 region (Figure 2).
The region upstream of PSPTO_5053 (ID: P_5751489) appears to have an atypical - 35 region (GGAAAC) and is longer than the others by 1 nucleotide.
This subtle change at - 35, however, can be tolerated by extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factors, of which HrpL is an example [55], [56].
Associated sequence read counts at HrpL-binding sites were also computed to represent magnitude of enrichment (Figure 3A).
All enrichment values from the hrpL-FLAG strain (ranging from 4.7 for P_922939 to 502.0 for P_5384493) are typically much larger than the corresponding values from the DeltahrpL strain (0.0 for most cases; 4.0 for P_5346774).
The resemblance of the candidate promoters to the canonical hrp promoter consensus sequence, together with the evidence that HrpL binds at their genomic locations suggests that they are genuine HrpL-responsive promoters.



Genome-wide identification of TSSs in RNA-Seq

Active promoters should be associated with nearby transcription start sites (TSSs).
Using high-throughput sequencing methods, we mapped TSSs by modifying a stranded RNA-Seq protocol to enrich for primary mRNA transcripts (i.e., those bearing a 5'-triphosphate group) [46].
A unique 18 nucleotide tag was ligated to the 5' end primary transcripts so that they could be readily identified (see Materials and Methods).
The resulting RNA-Seq data contain both whole transcriptome and TSS information (Table 2).

To identify conserved motifs associated with TSS, the 1500 tagged ends with the most abundant reads were selected for analysis.
We extracted 50 nucleotides directly upstream from each captured 5'-end, resulting in 1451 sequences derived from the hrpL-FLAG sample and 1472 sequences from the DeltahrpL sample (overlapping sequences within a sample were merged) and used the sequences as input to MEME [51].
Three motifs with structures resembling canonical promoters were detected in the hrpL-FLAG sequences (Figure S1).
These include likely RpoD (motif 1, 5'-ttG-N20- TANaaT-3') [33] and RpoF (motif 2, 5'-TaAaG-N15-GcCGAta-3') [57] promoters as well as the putative hrp promoter (motif 3, 5'-GgAACc - N16 - 17-CCAN-3') [23].
We also recovered a weak motif resembling the RpoN promoter (motif 4, 5'-TgG-N10-TGC-3') [58].
Two motifs were recovered from the DeltahrpL samples, motif 1 (RpoD) and motif 2 (RpoF).
The putative RpoF promoters derived in both cases are upstream of genes likely to be regulated by this sigma factor, such as fliC (PSPTO_1949), fliD (PSPTO_1951), flgK (PSPTO_1944), cheY-2 (PSPTO_1980) and cheA-2 (PSPTO_1982) (see supplemental data).
As expected, the HrpL motif was identified in the hrpL-FLAG but not the DeltahrpL samples.

The overall number of detected promoter motifs contrasts with results reported by Filiatrault et al.[46], who identified nine distinct motifs upstream from captured 5'-ends (including the hrp promoter) using the similar MEME parameters but different DC3000 culture conditions and sample preparation methods.
However, in agreement with that report, we also observed that captured ends tend to occur in tightly spaced clusters (see example in Figure 3B).
TSS clustering has been noted in other bacteria [59], [60] and in DC3000 for both PvdS and HrpL-associated promoters [46].
The most abundant TSS signal, as well as the signal closest to each promoter candidate, is shown in Table S5.
In bacteria, transcription begins 10 bps or less downstream from -10 promoter elements [61].
In four cases the distance between a hrp promoter candidate and its closest captured 5'-end exceeds this limit (candidates upstream of PSPTO_1022, PSPTO_A0005, PSPTO_A0012, and PSPTO_B0078).
Although these promoters may simply be inactive, it is also possible that the TSSs are undetectable because they are rapidly degraded in the cell or during sample processing.
Previous experimental evidence suggests that all four of these hrp promoters are genuine [21] - [23].
Another hrp promoter candidate, between PSPTO_3948 and PSPTO_3949, is approximately 30 bps distant from the closest TSS.
Validation tests suggest that this promoter supports HrpL-dependent transcription (below).
In summary, all 20 candidate hrp promoters are associated with regions enriched by ChIP-Seq and a plausible hrp promoter motif; most are positioned close to captured 5'-ends (between 0 - 7 bps).
It is therefore likely that these represent bona fide HrpL-dependent promoters.



Multiple methods validate candidate HrpL-dependent promoters

The twenty hrp promoters discussed above were analyzed further using ChIP-qPCR, reporter fusions and qRT-PCR to confirm HrpL binding, promoter function and HrpL-dependent transcription.

Cells for ChIP-qPCR were cultured and collected independently from those used for ChIP-Seq.
Analysis of the DNA isolated by immunoprecipitation confirmed enrichment at 19 out of 20 targets (Figure 4A).
The exception was P_922939, located upstream of PSPTO_5618 (pseudogene for HopAT1).
This promoter also has a relatively weak signal in the ChIP-Seq experiment.
However, PSPTO_5618 was transcribed in a HrpL-dependent manner in our other tests (described below).

A plasmid-based reporter trap assay was designed to test promoter activity at defined chromosomal regions and to isolate promoter activity from potentially confounding effects such as read-through from transcription initiated further upstream.
Genomic fragments of 100 to 200 nucleotides containing candidate promoters were used to construct transcriptional fusions with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter.
Although the basal expression of each promoter was different on KB, all twenty regions showed strong induction in hrp-inducing medium compared to KB (Figure 4B).
P_3929018 (PSPTO_3481) exhibits robust expression on both rich medium and hrp-inducing medium, suggesting that the cloned region contains a promoter that is constitutively expressed.
However, qRT-PCR shows that transcription of PSPTO_3481 is 15-fold higher in DC3000 vs. DeltahrpL (below).
A hrp promoter motif at this location was identified in an earlier global transcriptional map [46].
It is possible that this region contains HrpL-dependent and independent promoters.

A qRT-PCR assay was used to assess HrpL-dependent transcription in regions downstream from candidate hrp promoters in their native genomic context.
Relative transcript abundance for candidates was computed by comparing relative transcript levels at 1.5 hours after shifting bacterial cells from KB to MG (iron supplemented) medium, normalized to mRNA levels for gyrA, a housekeeping gene (Figure 4C).
Most previously reported hrp promoters were associated with strong induction in this experiment (Figure S2).
When the relative induction of transcripts in the DeltahrpL mutant is compared to that of WT DC3000 in hrp-inducing medium, genes downstream from 18 of the new promoter candidates show a strong HrpL-dependent expression.
P_406224 (upstream of PSPTO_0371) showed the largest induction in this experiment (>1000x), with four others showing levels GTEQ 100x.
P_2012122 (upstream of PSPTO_1843) shows only small differences in mRNA levels between the two backgrounds.
P_4199618, upstream of PSPTO_3721, showed no significant induction using qRT-PCR but did exhibit HrpL-dependent behavior in the reporter trap assay.
This promoter may depend on other factors for transcription or may ordinarily function at a very low level of activity.

P_5384493 was verified in all experiments.
This hrp promoter candidate is in an intragenic region downstream of PSPTO_4750 (a hypothetical protein) but is oriented in the antisense direction.
As shown in Figure S3, the captured 5' TSS in close proximity to this promoter is consistent with antisense transcription.
Although our qRT-PCR protocol cannot distinguish between transcripts arising from complementary regions, the candidate promoter cloned into our GFP fusion construct showed 2.5 fold induction in hrp-inducing compared to KB rich medium.



Results compared with a computational inventory of hrp promoters

Sequence pattern matching has been used extensively to inventory the HrpL regulon in DC3000 [23], [25], [62].
To help determine whether the procedures described above identified all DC3000 hrp promoters, we scanned the DC3000 genome using a hidden Markov model trained using previously annotated and new hrp promoter sequences (Table S2) and compared the results to those obtained by ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq.
Although the scan matched all annotated and new candidate hrp promoters identified in this study, the model did not match any other region in the genome that showed enrichment in the ChIP-Seq experiment (E-value cut-off===0.001, 245 promoter candidates in total).
As a further precaution, the E-value threshold for a match was reset to 0.01, an even more relaxed level that predicts 424 hrp promoters in the DC3000 genome.
Among matches that are unassociated with confirmed promoters, five are in regions where ChIP-Seq shows weak enrichment (Table S4).
These genes are not associated with detectable TSSs within an appropriate distance.
The hrp promoter-like sequence upstream of PSPTO_0816 (Type IV pilus biogenesis protein) was examined more closely.
This candidate shows no significant enrichment using ChIP-qPCR, and does not demonstrate HrpL-dependent transcription using qRT-PCR (data not shown).
However, a transcriptional promoter fusion involving this region exhibits a 10.9 fold induction in hrp-inducing medium (Table S4).
The candidate hrp promoter is similar to the canonical hrp promoter within the - 35 region, but varies at two bases within the - 10 region (CAACCAA instead of CCACNNA; Table S4).
While it is possible that the induction is due to this promoter candidate rather than some other cryptic promoter, the data are equivocal and the candidate has not been included in Table 3.
We suspect that other candidates identified using extremely relaxed criteria will be similarly difficult to classify with confidence.



The new members of the DC3000 HrpL regulon are largely unrelated to virulence

The annotated functions of the genes associated with the new hrp promoters do not appear to involve the T3SS machinery or add to the effector repertoire, with the possible exception of PSPTO_5633 (see below).
In order to determine whether the new genes contribute to pathogenicity, we constructed deletion mutants (in WT DC3000 and DeltahopQ1-1 backgrounds) for seven candidates whose annotated functions were suggestive of plant association and examined them for an altered virulence phenotype in N. benthamiana (PSPTO_5633, PSPTO_0371, PSPTO_2691, PSPTO_2696, PSPTO_3331, PSPTO_5240 and PSPTO_2130).
No phenotypic differences were observed for in planta growth, virulence, or HR for any strain (data not shown).
The result for PSPTO_2130 is consistent with another analysis reported for this gene [26].
Although it is not uncommon for effector mutants to fail to exhibit a phenotype (due to functional redundancy [28], [29], [63]), most of these genes are unlikely to be effectors (see Discussion).
It is possible that some of the remaining 13 candidates will demonstrate phenotypes if mutated and tested.



PSPTO_5633 appears to be a weak Type III secretion effector

Although PSPTO_5633 has no annotated function, it shares high sequence similarity with hypothetical proteins in some pathogenic bacterial species (such as P. syringae pv. maculicola, Erwinia tracheiphila, Citrobacter rodentium, Burkholderia phymatum, Xanthomonas campestris and Yersinia mollaretii), which is frequently the case for an effector.
However, the TEREE (Type III Effector Relative Entropy Evaluation) score for this gene is - 2 [64], which is outside of the range exhibited by most effectors ( - 13 to - 47).
Nonetheless we investigated PSPTO_5633 as a potential effector.
Figure 5A shows PSPTO_5633 and its neighboring hrp promoter motif, aligned with the ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq and 5'-capture profiles in this genomic region.

As effectors need to be transported into the plant cytoplasm to interact with plant defenses, we tested PSPTO_5633 for its ability to translocate into plant cells.
Figure 5B shows that PSPTO_5633 enters plant cells in a T3SS dependent manner.
PSPTO_5633 translocation is weak when compared to that for AvrPto but is significantly above background, a result supported by multiple experimental replicates.
Based on these results, PSPTO_5633 has been assigned the name HopBM1 to recognize its role as an effector.

A closer look at the N-terminal region of PSPTO_5633 surprisingly suggests that this protein may be secreted through the Sec pathway (see Figure 5C).
To test this possibility, translocation of PSPTO_5633 was assayed in a DeltagspD background (T2SS - ).
The level of cAMP observed using a T2SS - strain was indistinguishable from that seen with DC3000 (Figure 5B), suggesting that PSPTO_5633 does not enter plant cells using this pathway.



Comparative genome analysis of the HrpL regulon

Although a sigma factor regulon can be described as a tightly integrated collection of genes, the composition of the HrpL regulon across species is not rigid.
While the core effector delivery system is highly conserved, the effector proteins delivered by it vary considerably [65] in other P. syringae pathovars.
In order to determine whether the new HrpL regulon members show similar patterns of conservation, we conducted an in silico analysis in which we examined genome sequences from 121 members of the P. syringae group, most of which are plant pathogens.
The group (taxid 136849) is defined by NCBI in their taxonomy database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy).
We identified orthologs to the DC3000 genes immediately downstream from the 73 hrp promoters and then examined the DNA sequences upstream from them for patterns matching the hrp promoter (Figure 6).
As expected, nearly all of the P. syringae group genomes contain HrpL orthologs.
hrp promoter motifs are observed upstream of most other regulon orthologs (bright red squares) including those corresponding to the new regulon members (shown with names on a green background).
Genes for core T3SS functions are widely shared across the group, whereas orthologs for the DC3000 effector genes are not as conserved, reflecting effector diversity.
About half of the new regulon members are as conserved as the core T3SS genes.
Others (such as PSPTO_5633 and PSPTO_3481) exhibit a different pattern and are found only in DC3000 and a few other P. syringae genomes (Figure S4).
This sparse distribution resembles that found for effectors such as PSPTO_4691 (HopAD1) and PSPTO_4703 (HopAQ1).
Note that ortholog absence should be interpreted cautiously since it can reflect errors in genome assembly or shortcomings in the methods used to identify reciprocal best BLASTP matches, as well as the actual absence of an ortholog in a genome.

A substantially different result is obtained when the analysis is extended to all Pseudomonadales genome sequences (1060 organisms total), most of which are neither plant pathogens nor contain HrpL orthologs (Table S3).
Orthologs for core regulon components are rarely detected outside the P. syringae group.
In contrast, several new regulon members are widely represented (Figures 7 and S4).
Examples are PSPTO_1843 (aspartate kinase), PSPTO_3721 (enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase) and PSPTO_4955 (thiosulfate sulfurtransferase/phosphatidylserine decarboxylase) whose orthologs appear in almost all sequenced strains tested.
