Transcriptome of the PreA/PreB two-component system

In previous experiments, we realized that the preAB TCS was not fully activated during growth in LB, as indicated by the absence of regulatory effects on the two known target genes (yibD, pmrCAB) when comparing a nonpolar mutation in the preA response regulator to the wild type strain [3].
This was confirmed in this study by microarray analysis co-hybridizing preA and wild type cDNA to a multistrain slide microarray of Salmonella enterica (data not shown).
In our previous studies, transcriptional changes of the preAB target genes upon growth in LB was achieved by overexpression of PreA or by mutation of the sensor kinase preB [3].
We therefore analyzed the effect of overepressing PreA in a DeltapreA strain carrying preA driven by a pBAD arabinose-inducible promoter grown in buffered LB.
In addition, past experiments had implied that PreB may be acting as a protein phosphatase when bacteria are grown in LB [3].
If this is the case, some of the regulatory effects attributed to preA may have been dampened in the previous experimental design.
We therefore proceeded to also analyze the cDNA from a preAB double mutant expressing pBAD-preA and a preAB strain carrying the vector control.
All of the data from both experiments is included in Additional file 1, but a focused list of key candidate regulated genes is shown in Table 2.

Many of the genes upregulated in the DeltapreA strain overexpressing preA (Table 2, column 1) were reconfirmed in experiments with the preAB mutant strain overexpressing preA (Table 2, column 2), but with increased fold activation.
For instance, yibD was upregulated ~69-fold in the preAB mutant with pBAD-preA compared to the ~2-fold seen in PreB+ backgrounds, while mdaB was upregulated ~7-fold versus 2-fold in the PreB+ background.
In addition, one of the discernable patterns from the two microarrays was that the three genes flanking the preAB operon: ygiW, STM3175, mdaB, were upregulated 37-, 21-, and ~7-fold, respectively (Table 2, column 2).
Furthermore, in the preAB mutant background, we also observed upregulation of additional genes belonging to the PhoP/PhoQ and PmrA/PmrB regulons: pmrAB, udg, cptA (STM4118) and pagP.
This further supports the connection between preAB and the two major regulons controlling genes involved in LPS modifications and antimicrobial peptide resistance in Salmonella and provides confidence to the quality of our microarray experiments.



qRT-PCR analysis and transcriptional organization of preAB and flanking genes

To confirm the results of the microarray and to examine the regulation of preAB and the genes surrounding it, we performed qRT-PCR.
The preA gene was shown to be induced 344-fold in a DeltapreB strain vs. a wild type strain, furthering the previous finding of PreB acting primarily as a phosphatase when grown in LB and providing evidence of PreA-mediated positive autoregulation of preAB.
The induction of preB in the microarray of the preA mutant background overexpressing preA also provided evidence of positive autoregulation of preAB (supplement Table 1).
ygiW was strongly activated by PreA (355-fold) when comparing expression in a DeltapreAB/pBAD18-preA+strain vs. DeltapreAB/pBAD18.
Using these same strains, ygiN was more weakly activated by PreA (2.94-fold).
Several other PreA-regulated genes including STM3175 (605.3-fold) and mdaB (32.5-fold) were also analyzed by qRT-PCR, all confirming the regulation observed in the microarrays (though not always matching the observed fold-change) (Table 2).

The transcriptional organization of the preAB operon and of the genes flanking it, which were strongly upregulated by PreA, were analyzed by RT-PCR.
As shown in Fig. 1, PCR fragments spanning preA and preB, ygiW and STM3175, and mdaB and ygiN were observed, suggesting that these sets of genes are co-transcribed.
While primers spanning preB and mdaB (separated by a 106 bp intergenic region) yielded PCR product using a DNA template, no such product was observed with cDNA, even with the use of multiple primer sets, suggesting that these genes are not co-transcribed.
These data, coupled with the microarray results, suggest that PreA is necessary for the activation of the ygiW-STM3175, preA-preB, and mdaB-ygiN operons.

We next attempted to map the transcriptional start sites of these three operons by primer extension using a fluorescent primer protocol.
Using this approach, the start of transcription for the preAB operon was identified at -423/424 bp from the start codon, implying that the preAB promoter is internal to ygiW and contains a large, untranslated leader region (Fig. 2).
The start site of the ygiW-STM3175 operon was at -161 bp, which is 10 bp internal to the preA open reading frame.
Multiple attempts were made to map the mdaB-ygiN start, however we were unsuccessful at identifying a clear site for transcriptional initiation.



Phenotypes of preAB TCS mutants

We previously reported that PreA/PreB is orthologous to the E. coli QseBC system, which responds to AI-3 and epinephrine/norepinephrine signals.
In response to these signals, the QseC sensor kinase has been reported to affect motility in both E. coli and S. Typhimurium [6,14].
However, our microarray data did not suggest any major and/or consistent effect of PreA/PreB on transcription of the flagellar operon.
Therefore, we assessed the effects of mutations in preA and preB on the motility of S. Typhimurium on agar plates with DMEM as the culture medium.
The results showed a reduction in motility for the preB sensor mutant (Fig. 3) but not for the preA or preAB mutants.
As seen with QseC in E. coli, the addition of synthetic AI-2 did not complement the preB mutant motility defect and also did not affect the motility of the wild type strain (Fig. 3A).
Additionally, though epinephrine/norepinephrine has been reported to activate motility in both E. coli and S. Typhimurium [6,15], a slight but non-significant increase in wild type strain motility was observed in our assays using identical conditions and epinephrine concentrations used previously in E. coli.
Supplementation of the media with epinephrine did increase the motility of preA, preB and preAB mutants (all statistically significant except preB, Fig. 3B), but as this effect of epinephrine on S. Typhimurium motility was observed only in preA or preB mutant strains, this effect is not mediated by PreA/PreB.

Overexpression of mdaB [16] and mutation of preB (ygiY; [17]) were previously shown to affect drug resistance in E. coli and oxidative stress response in Helicobacter spp. [18-20].
In addition, catalase genes appear PreA-regulated (Additional file 1).
preAB mutant strains were therefore analyzed for resistance to various chemicals and antibiotics, including nalidixic acid, pyrazinoic acid, H2O2, paraquat, adriamycin, and tetracycline.
None of the mutants showed increased sensitivity when compared to the wild type strain (data not shown).

To determine if the PreA/PreB system affects virulence, mutant and wild type strains were perorally inoculated in mice and mortality was recorded over two weeks.
The preA mutant showed no virulence defect while mice infected with the preAB strain showed a consistent two day delay in mortality, but eventually all mice succumbed to infection (Fig. 4).
The preAB mutant strain also demonstrated a consistent competition infection defect (competitive index: spleen, 0.344; liver, 0.326) when co-inoculated by oral gavage with the wild type strain, which was not observed with strains containing single mutations in preA or preB (data not shown).
Thus, the PreA/PreB TCS has a slight but reproducible effect on virulence in mice.

Given that invasion of the small intestine is a prerequisite to systemic infection upon oral inoculation, we also evaluated the ability of various preA/preB mutants to invade HeLa cells grown in vitro.
Again, the response regulator (preA) mutant did not show any defect in invasion of HeLa cells.
The preB strain showed a marginal and non-significant reduction in invasion upon 2 hours co-cultivation at a MOI = 100 (invasion ~80% of wild type), while a larger defect was observed for the preAB double mutant (~30% of WT) (Fig. 5).
Therefore, the PreA/PreB TCS has a direct or indirect effect on host cell invasion.
