Training

This folder contains the background information, training guidelines, and examples. In addition, the training files in brat format are supplied under the data subdirectory.

The files for loading into a brat server must be in UNIX format -- that is, the lines end with LF and NOT CRLF. If the files end up with a Windows-style line ending, use the UNIX command dos2unix to convert them back to having LF line endings.
