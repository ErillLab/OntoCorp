Identification of promoter regions

We used lacZ as a reporter gene, to measure the activity of M. tuberculosis promoters thought to be regulated by PhoP in M. smegmatis, a non-pathogenic and fast-growing mycobacterial species.

Several fragments corresponding to upstream and structural gene regions of pks2 (-86,+60), msl3 (-282,+28) and fadD21 (-198, +10) were generated (Table 1).
These fragments were inserted upstream from the lacZ reporter gene in the pJEM15 E. coli-mycobacterial reporter shuttle plasmid.
For lipF, a 611 bp region (-596, +14) was used, because this region has previously been reported to be required for the upregulation of transcriptional activity in response to exposure to an acid stress.
This upregulation has been demonstrated in both pathogenic M. tuberculosis and non-pathogenic M. smegmatis strains [27].
Cultures of M. smegmatis transformed with the empty pJEM15 vector, a positive control, the pJEM31 (PAN) vector containing a promoter sequence, PAN, isolated from M. paratuberculosis[28] or recombinant pJEM15 plasmids carrying lipF, pks2, msl3 or fadD21 gene fragments were set up.
Aliquots of cultures were collected during the exponential growth phase and beta-galactosidase activities were assessed to determine transcription levels.

As indicated in Fig. 1, expression levels were higher for M. smegmatis transformed with the recombinant plasmids carrying pks2, msl3, lipF or fadD21 gene fusions than for M. smegmatis transformed with the empty pJEM15 vector.
No significant expression was detected for M. smegmatis transformed with the empty pJEM15 vector.
With the plasmid pJEM31 (PAN) used as a positive control, we observed expression of similar magnitude as observed for pks2, msl3 and fadD21.
A much lower expression was observed for M. smegmatis carrying the lipF fusion, under the conditions tested.
These results demonstrate that there was a promoter present in the various cloned regions in fusion with lacZ gene.



Identification of PhoP binding sites

We investigated whether PhoP bound directly to the DNA sequences upstream from lipF, pks2, msl3 and fadD21 identified in gene fusion studies, by carrying out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with phosphorylated PhoP protein (PhoP-P).
In fact, previous studies have shown that PhoP must be phosphorylated for efficient binding to specific sites.
We also carried out EMSA with the regulatory binding region of the PhoP gene itself, Protect40, as a positive control [29], [30].
Only positive bindings were shown in Fig. 2.
We started by using PCR fragments of about 200 bp in size for EMSA (Table 1, Table 2, and Fig. 2A).
For the lipF promoter region, we generated three 200 bp subfragments: lipFa (-596 to -375), lipFb (-394 to -168) and lipFc (-167 to +14).
Only lipFa displayed a clear shift in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of PhoP-P (Fig. 2A and Fig.S1).
For msl3, we generated two subfragments: msl3a (-282 to -49), which was about 200 bp in length, and msl3b (-67 to +28), which was about 100 bp long.
Only msl3a displayed a clear shift in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of PhoP-P (Fig. 2A).

The 147 bp (-86 to +60) pks2 and the 209 bp (-198 to +10) fadD21 fragments used in beta-galactosidase experiments also displayed a clear shift in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of PhoP-P (Fig. 2A).
To address relative affinity differences between the DNA substrates, we varied the protein to DNA ratio to obtain a complete shift.
The protein concentrations used ranged from 0 to 8 microM, for a constant DNA concentration of 40 nM.
All five regulatory regions studied (lipF, pks2, msl3, fadD21 and phoP) bound to PhoP-P resulted in the detection of higher molecular weight bands.
For msl3a, fadD21 and pks2, a PhoP-P:DNA ratio of 100:1 was sufficient to obtain an almost complete shift, whereas a ratio of 200:1 was required for lipFa.
The various DNA segments thus have different affinities for PhoP-P (Fig. 2).
A faint second band of higher molecular weight was observed for Protect-40, but not for the other targets analyzed here.
All reactions were tested for the requirement for phosphorylation (Fig. 2).
Non-phosphorylated assays are shown (Fig.S2).
No significant binding was observed in absence of phosphorylation.

Using the data obtained with the large fragments, we carried out a sequence alignment analysis of all the fragments shown to bind PhoP-P.
The regions similar to DR1/DR2 and DR3 previously identified in the phoP promoter [26] were observed.

We applied trimming and walking techniques to the initial oligonucleotides to generate subsequent fragments of 50 to 100 bp in size (Fig. 2B, Fig. 3) and proceeded with PhoP-P binding.

The results from the EMSAs on the subfragments were analyzed in the context of the presence or absence of the DR repeats.
In addition to lipFa, we also tested two shorter DNA regions for binding: lipFa1 (-575 to -508) and lipFa2 (-465 to -377).
Binding was observed only with lipFa1, which contains DR1 - 3, at a PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM, but not for lipFa2.
For pks2, we tested four additional shorter DNA regions: pks2a (-52 to +6), pks2b (-95 to -56), pks2c (+10 to +86) and pks2d (-86 to +15).
Binding was observed for pks2d, which contains a partial DR1 and DR2 - 3 (at a PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM).
Only very weak binding was observed for pks2a, which contained a DR3 sequence alone (at a PhoP-P concentration of 10 microM), and for pks2b, which contained only DR1 and DR2 sequences (at a PhoP-P concentration of 20 microM).
pks2c which does not contain any of the DRs did not give any binding (Fig. 2B).
We studied msl3a binding in more detail with two additional DNA fragments: msl3a1 (-242 to -198) and msl3a2 (-269 to -188).
Binding was observed for both of these fragments; msl3a2 which contains the entire DR1 - 3 (binding observed at a PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM), whereas msl3a1 contains only the first 3 bp of DR3 (binding at a PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM).
Finally, fadD21 was studied by testing two additional DNA regions: fadD21a (-152 to -98), and fadD21b (-145 to -61).
Binding was observed for fadD21b, which contained all three DR sequences (PhoP-P concentration of 2 microM).
Only very weak binding was observed for fadD21a, which contained only DR1 and partial DR2 (PhoP-P concentration of 10 microM), as for pks2b, which also contained only DR1 - 2 (PhoP-P concentration of 20 microM).
However, in assays of PhoP-P binding to Protect40, full binding was observed when we used a DR1 - 2-containing fragment (PhoP-P concentration of 4 microM).
Interestingly, reducing the size of the DNA targets (45 - 102 bp) resulted in a decrease in the protein/DNA ratio (only 1:50) required to obtain a shift, (Fig. 2B), showing that we indeed were able to increase the affinity as we narrowed down the targets to match the DRs.

The transcription initiation sites were determined for lipF, pks2 and msl3 in previous studies [31], [32].
This allowed us to locate DR1, DR2 and DR3 with regard to the transcription start.

We investigated the importance of the repeat motifs in sequence-specific DNA binding by PhoP, using oligonucleotides with altered nucleotide sequences Pho1, Pho2, Pho3 (Table 2, Fig. 2C and 3E) in place of DR1, DR2 or combined DR1/DR2 sequences, respectively whereby we removed one or all of the DR1 - 2 repeats.
The Protect-40 wild-type sequence was used as a control (Fig. 2C).
The Pho1 - Pho3 altered sequences severely impaired PhoP-P binding.
These results confirm that the binding of PhoP to the phoP promoter region is dependent on the direct repeat motifs.



Characterization of the PhoP binding site by DNase I footprinting

We defined the DNA regions binding PhoP more precisely, by carrying out DNase I protection assays on the PhoP-P/DNA target complex.
We used the lipF, pks2, fadD21 and msl3 promoter regions for these protection experiments.
PhoP-P binding enhanced the protection of these four promoters against DNase I digestion (Fig. 4).
The protected regions for pks2, msl3 and fadD21 were approximately 50 to 70 bp long (Fig. 4).
For pks2 and fadD21, these regions include coverage of the DRs, the spacer region between them, with a complete DR3 motif.
In the case of msl3, the DR3 is partially protected until position A7 known for being present in all the DRs (Table 3, [26]).
The protected region of lipF is only 30 - 35 bp in length and the DR3 region is not protected by PhoP protein.



DR sequence analyses

Using two different approaches (see Materials and Methods section), we identified three motifs matching the original DR1, DR2 and DR3 repeats of the PhoP promoter.
These repeats are also present in all target regions upstream the lipF, pks2, msl3 and fadD21 genes (Fig. 5).
The degree of sequence identity to the consensus of the canonical DR1 - 3 motifs of the phoP promoter region [23] ranged from 56% to 89% (Table 3).
DR1 was the most conserved motif, followed by DR2, and then DR3.
The DR1 and DR2 motifs were separated by 1 to 5 bp.
By contrast, DR2 and DR3 were separated by 13 to 35 bp (Fig. 5).
Taking this into account, we analyzed the distribution of the consensus sequences for each motif throughout the MTB genome.
Motif configurations with only DR1 and DR2, or with DR1, DR2 and DR3 were observed in the upstream regions of 87 genes, accounting for 83.9% and 16.1% of total cases, respectively.
The identified genes were analyzed according to the classes of the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COGs) classification [29], [30] (Fig. 6A, Table S1).
We further investigated, using the Tuberculist data, the function of genes that are not listed in COGs (38 genes, Fig. 6B).
Some of the identified genes have already been reported to be regulated by PhoP on the basis of transcriptomic data [20], [21].
Based on the COG classification, we found that PhoP play a key role as a putative transcription regulator mostly for genes involved in transcription (21%) and Secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism (14%), lipid transport and metabolism (9%), and coenzyme transport and metabolism (9%) (Fig. 6A).
