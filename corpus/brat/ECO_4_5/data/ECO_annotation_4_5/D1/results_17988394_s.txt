Identification and sequence analysis of the fhaB gene of B. holmesii

Based on short regions of highly conserved nucleotide sequences of the 5'- and 3'-ends of the fhaB genes of B. avium and B. pertussis oligonucleotide pairs Fha1F/Fha1R and Fha2F/Fha2R were designed and used for PCR amplification with chromosomal DNA of B. holmesii.
For both primer combinations PCR products could be amplified.
The sequence analysis of the amplified DNA fragments revealed significant similarity in particular in the deduced amino acid sequence to the respective fhaB sequences of the other Bordetellae.
By PCR amplification using the primer pair Fha1F/Fha1R, we found that all B. holmesii strains tested (B. holmesii G7702, B. holmesii G8341, B. holmesii ATCC51541 and B. holmesii No1) harbour orthologues of this fhaB gene (data not shown).
Using a genome walking strategy the DNA sequence of the fhaB gene of strain B. holmesii G7702 was completed.
The fhaB coding region of B. holmesii starts with a GTG codon and comprises 8,793 bp with a coding capacity for a 304 kDa protein, which is smaller than FHA of B. pertussis (367 kDa) but larger than the respective protein of B. avium (273 kDa).
The genome organisation of the fhaB locus of B. holmesii differs from that of the other Bordetella species.
In B. holmesii, upstream of the fhaB gene an open reading frame (orfMP) is located with significant similarity to a conserved integral membrane protein of B. bronchiseptica (BB3004) and B. parapertussis (BPP3041) which is transcribed divergently.
Directly downstream of the fhaB gene a copy of the insertion element IS1001 is located which is known to occur in B. holmesii and in B. parapertussis.
In contrast, in the species belonging to the B. bronchiseptica cluster the fhaB gene is arranged between the divergently transcribed bvgAS locus and the fimbrial operon fimABCD which precedes the fhaC gene whose gene product is involved in the export of FHA.
In B. avium an ORF encoding an ABC transporter is present upstream of fhaB, while the downstream gene organization is similar to the B. bronchiseptica cluster (Fig. 1) [3,17,18].

The overall similarity of the nucleotide sequence of the fhaB gene of B. holmesii with those of B. avium and B. pertussis is low (between 50% and 52%) explaining the failure of previous attempts to detect an fhaB orthologue in this species by Southern hybridization experiments (data not shown).
Even in those regions of the B. holmesii fhaB gene (e.g. within the first 600 bp) in which the predicted amino acid sequences of the FHA proteins are quite conserved (see below), the nucleotide sequence similarity is quite limited (59%).
On the level of the deduced amino acid sequences, the B. holmesii FHA protein shows an overall similarity of 55% to the FHA protein of B. avium (Fig. 1).
The similarity to the FHA, FhaL and FhaS proteins of the members of the B. bronchiseptica complex is less pronounced, e.g. 39.2% to FHA of B. pertussis as calculated using the EMBOSS pairwise alignment algorithms (Table 1).
With a sequence similarity of 37.3% the most similar protein outside of the genus Bordetella is an adhesin-like protein from Yersinia frederiksenii, an environmental bacterium that can also be associated with a wide variety of host organisms [28].
This analysis shows that FHA of B. holmesii is more similar to the B. avium protein than to the related factors of the mammalian pathogens, in line with previous observations that the BvgA, BvgS and RecA proteins of B. holmesii and B. avium are more closely related to each other than they are to those of the B. bronchiseptica complex [29,30].
This contrasts previous data obtained by comparison of the 16S rDNA sequences, which placed B. holmesii as a new species closer to B. pertussis than to B. avium.
On the other hand, recent evidence indicated that the gene encoding the 16S RNA of B. holmesii may have been acquired horizontally from B. pertussis [30].

For the Sec-dependent secretion across the cytoplasmic membrane, the B. holmesii FHA protein has an extended N-terminal signal sequence, which is very similar to that of the B. pertussis protein.
In B. pertussis, the signal sequence is cleaved at an alanine at sequence position 71 probably by the Lep signal peptidase [6].
The B. holmesii FHA protein has also an alanine residue at this position suggesting its processing at this site after transport through the cytoplasmic membrane.
In addition, the N-terminus of B. pertussis FHA harbours a domain about 250 amino acid residues in length which is essential for secretion through the outer membrane according to the two-partner secretion model, the so-called TPS domain [31].
The exact nature of the transport signal is not known so far, but two sequence motifs (NPNL and NPNGI) are well conserved among two-partner secreted proteins and at least the NPNL motif plays a role in the secretion of B. pertussis FHA [32].
Both sequence motifs are also present in the FHA protein of B. holmesii suggesting that it is also exported via a two-partner secretion mechanism.

Similarities of the B. holmesii protein with domains of the B. pertussis FHA protein possibly involved in adhesion including the heparin binding (aa 442 - 862) and carbohydrate recognition domains (CRD) (aa 1141 - 1279) are very limited and the elucidation of relevant binding activities must await the biochemical characterization of the B. holmesii FHA protein.
An intriguing feature of the FHA protein of B. pertussis is the presence of an RGD motif (aa 1097 - 1099) enabling the protein to interact with integrin receptors [2].
The B. holmesii protein does not contain an RGD motif, instead at sequence position 742 - 744 it harbours a KGD motif (Fig. 2).
In some cases, KGD motifs may be involved in integrin binding [33,34], however, ascribing such a function to the KGD motif of the B. holmesii protein must await future experimental analysis.



Regulation of expression of the B. holmesii fhaB gene

Upstream of the fhaB gene a divergently transcribed gene is present suggesting that the fhaB gene has a promoter of its own.
To analyse the regulatory region of the fhaB gene (PfhaB) it was cloned upstream of a promoterless gfp gene in the broad host range vector pMMB208 and the resulting plasmid was introduced into B. holmesii.
By primer extension analysis with a gfp-specific primer three transcripts (P1 - P3) were identified initiating at sequence positions -58 (P1), -71 (P2) and -88 (P3) with respect to the translational start codon of the fhaB gene (Fig. 3).
No obvious -10 and -35 regions could be observed upstream of any of these putative transcriptional start sites.
To investigate whether, similar to the other Bordetellae, the BvgAS system is involved in the control of fhaB expression, primer extension analysis was performed on RNA extracted from a B. holmesii bvgAS mutant [27] harbouring the plasmid-borne PfhaB-gfp fusion.
Interestingly, the longest of the three transcripts (P3) was not detected in the bvgAS mutant indicating that the synthesis of this transcript is controlled by the BvgAS system, while the other transcripts are constitutively produced under our experimental conditions (Fig. 3).
Similarly, the fhaB gene of B. pertussis is controlled by a BvgAS regulated promoter, but some constitutive expression was noted [35].

Although the fhaB gene is transcribed in B. holmesii grown at standard culture conditions, various attempts to detect the B. holmesii FHA protein were not successful so far.
The B. holmesii strains used in this study grow very poorly in liquid culture reaching a maximal OD600 of about 0,5.
We were unable to detect a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to FHA in the culture supernatants neither by SDS PAGE nor by immune blotting using a polyclonal antiserum against the B. pertussis FHA protein.
Similarly, also in whole cell lysates of bacteria grown on BG agar plates no FHA protein could be detected (data not shown).
It is therefore possible, that the translation efficiency of the fhaB gene is low, which may be in line with the fact that the open reading frame starts with a GTG codon, or that the protein is processed to smaller fragments than the related proteins of the other Bordetellae.

To further investigate the transcriptional regulation of the fhaB gene by the BvgAS system we performed DNA binding experiments in vitro with purified recombinant BvgABH of B. holmesii [27].
In fact, in band shift experiments binding of the phosphorylated but not of the unphosphorylated BvgABH protein to the fhaB upstream region could be detected (Fig. 4).
Binding was specific since addition of unspecific competitor DNA did not interfere with binding of BvgABH-P even in the presence of a 1,000 fold excess of competitor DNA (data not shown).
To further characterize BvgA binding to the promoter region, DNase I footprint analysis with BvgABH of B. holmesii was performed.
Footprint experiments were carried out on a 312 bp DNA segment ranging from nucleotide position +29 to -283 as numbered with respect to the translational start site of the fhaB gene.
The addition of BvgABH-P to the reaction mixture resulted in a large region protected from DNase I digestion ranging from position -40 to -243 with respect to the start codon of fhaB.
Within the protected region the appearance of a regular pattern of hypersensitive sites every 10 to 11 nucleotides could be observed (Fig. 5), a phenomenon which was noted previously in the case of the promoter of the bvgAS operon of B. holmesii [27].
Surprisingly, the protected area covers all three transcriptional start sites mapped by primer extension analysis and, accordingly, includes the corresponding core promoter elements.
It is not clear whether this observation has in vivo relevance.

A search for putative BvgA binding sites within the fhaB promoter region revealed the presence of four sequence motifs termed BS1 to BS4, respectively, with similarities to the well defined BvgA binding sites in B. pertussis (Fig. 6) which are located within or close to the region protected by BvgABH-P in the footprint experiments.
BS2 and BS3 show high similarity to each other and consist of inverted repeat heptanucleotide sequences centered at position -117 and -65.5 relative to the start site of transcript P3.
The left and right half-site motifs of BS2 and BS3 match the consensus half-site motif for binding of B. pertussis BvgA (BvgABP) [15] in 4 and 5 (BS2) and 5 (BS3) out of seven positions.
BS1 is arranged as a direct heptanucleotide repeat whose half-sites match the consensus in 5 and 6 positions, respectively, and is centered at position -161.
BS4 which consists of an inverted repeat centered at position -47.5 shows the lowest similarity to the consensus heptanucleotide BvgABP binding motif (4 and 3 matches per half-site).
The fhaB promoter of B. pertussis comprises a heptanucleotide inverted repeat sequence with high affinity for BvgABP binding centered at position -88.5 relative to the transcriptional start, as well as two additional low affinity binding sites centered at position -67.5 and directly adjacent to the -35 region [14,15].
Cooperative binding of BvgABP to the secondary binding sites which show only limited similarity to the high-affinity inverted repeat motif is required for full transcriptional activation of the fhaB promoter of B. pertussis [15,35].
Remarkably, the positions of the low-affinity BvgABP binding sites in the fhaB promoter of B. pertussis and of BS3 and BS4 in the upstream region of fhaB from B. holmesii are almost identical.
However, while the high-affinity binding site in the fhaB promoter of B. pertussis is located immediately 5' adjacent to the low-affinity sites, the centers of the inverted repeat sequences BS2 and BS3 are located in a distance of 51 bp.
The most prominent sites showing hypersensitivity to DNase I cleavage in footprint experiments map to the region flanked by BS2 and BS3 (Fig. 5).

To investigate a functional role of these putative BvgA binding site(s) we performed a deletion analysis of the fhaB promoter region and carried out band shift assays with progressively 5'- truncated DNA fragments lacking BS1 to BS4.
As shown in Fig. 7, BvgABH-P bound equally well to DNA fragments comprising the four putative BvgA binding sites BS1 to BS4 and to a DNA fragment lacking BS1 suggesting a negligible role of BS1 for the activation of the BvgA-P dependent promoter of fhaB.
In agreement with this assumption, BS1 was only partially protected by BvgABH-P binding in DNase I footprint experiments (Fig. 6).
When BvgABH-P was incubated with a DNA fragment lacking both BS1 and BS2 still a distinct DNA-protein complex was formed, however, binding was significantly weaker since a much higher amount of BvgABH-P was required to achieve a band shift.
No significant binding of BvgABH-P was detectable to DNA fragments containing only BS4 or no BS box at all.
These data suggest a functional role of the highly similar BS2 and BS3 sites for binding of BvgABH-P to the fhaB upstream region.

To test whether these in vitro data have also relevance in vivo, DNA fragments containing various pieces of the fhaB upstream region were cloned in a promoterless gfp expression vector and transferred to the B. holmesii wild type and the bvgAS mutant strain.
GFP expression directed from the different constructs was used as a measure for promoter activity.
GFP expression was strong in the B. holmesii wild type strain harbouring construct pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0 containing the entire fhaB upstream region, while very low amounts of GFP were detected in the bvgAS mutant harbouring the same plasmid (Fig. 8, compare lanes 1 and 2).
These data confirm the BvgAS mediated regulation of fhaB expression which was already observed on the transcriptional level (Fig. 3).
Moreover, corroborating the in vitro data, GFP expression was virtually absent in strains B. holmesii G7702 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp4) and B. holmesii G7702 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp6) whose gfp expression plasmids contained only site BS4 or did not contain a BS site at all (Fig. 8, lanes 5 and 6).
In agreement with the results of the DNA binding experiments a dramatic increase in GFP expression could be noted when the fhaB upstream region in the gfp expression plasmids comprised BS3 or BS2 and BS3 in addition to BS4 (Fig. 8, lanes 4 and 3).
The virtually identical GFP expression directed from the pMMB208-fhaP-gfp3 (containing BS3 and BS4) and pMMB208-fhaP-gfp2 (containing BS2 to BS4) plasmids was surprising since the EMSA studies reported above revealed a relatively weak binding of BvgABH-P to a promoter fragment containing BS3 and BS4, while binding to a fragment comprising BS2 to BS4 was very efficient suggesting a prominent role of BS2 for transcriptional activation.
Since BS3 is fairly similar to the consensus BvgABP binding motif and is located at the appropriate position to allow the interaction between BvgABH and the C-terminal domain of the alpha subunit of RNA polymerase, BvgABH binding to BS3 facilitated by DNA topology effects might be sufficient to fully activate the plasmid-borne fhaB promoter in pMMB208-fhaP-gfp3.
In the presence of the full length fhaB promoter cooperative protein interactions are likely be involved in the binding of BvgABH to the BS2/BS3 region.

To investigate whether the fhaB promoter of B. holmesii is also recognized by the BvgA protein of B. pertussis, the pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0 plasmid containing the entire promoter region of the B. holmesii fhaB gene fused to GFP was introduced into the B. pertussis strains Tohama I (TI) and BP359.
Strong GFP expression was observed by immunoblot analysis in the wildtype strain TI (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0), while expression of the reporter gene was hardly detectable in the bvgAS mutant BP359 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0) (data not shown).
Interestingly, primer extension analysis performed with RNA extracted from TI (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0) and BP359 (pMMB208-fhaP-gfp0) using a gfp-specific oligonucleotide demonstrated that in the wild type strain transcription of gfp starts at two sites, which, however, are identical to the start sites of transcripts P1 and P3 synthesized from constitutive (P1) and bvg-dependent (P3) dependent promoters in B. holmesii.
Moreover, as observed in B. holmesii, in B. pertussis the promoter directing the synthesis of transcript P3 is not transcribed anymore when the BvgAS system is inactivated (data not shown).
These data suggest that the activation mechanism of the fhaB promoter of B. holmesii by the BvgA proteins of B. holmesii and B. pertussis is remarkably similar.
This is surprising since it was recently shown that the BvgA protein of B. holmesii does not bind to and cannot activate the fhaB promoter of B. pertussis, although in particular in its C-terminal output domain it is highly related to the BvgA protein of B. pertussis [27,36].
