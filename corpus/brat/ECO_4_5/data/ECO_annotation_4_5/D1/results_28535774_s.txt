Inactivation of esi promotes the epothilone production in S. cellulosum So0157-2

Using the conjugation and subsequent homologous recombination protocols as previously described [38], we inactivated genes flanking the epothilone gene cluster in S. cellulosum So0157-2 to determine whether they were associated with the synthesis, regulation or modification of epothilones.
The SCE1572_25030 gene locates approximately 500 bp upstream to the epothilone promoter (Fig. 1a).
We amplified an internal fragment of the gene and cloned it into the pCC11 plasmid [38] to construct the inactivation vector, which was introduced into the genome of So0157-2.
The gene was inactivated by insertional mutagenesis, which was confirmed by amplification using Tail-PCR and sequencing of the insertion region.

We fermented the mutant and the wild type strain in 50 mL of EMP medium supplemented with 2% of XAD-16 resin [16].
After 7 days of shaking cultivation, the resin was harvested, and the absorbed compounds were extracted for High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis to determine the yields of epothilones.
The results showed that the insertion mutation of SCE1572_25030 resulted in a remarkable increase in the yields of epothilones A and B, from 2.2 and 1.4 mg/L in the wild type strain to 4.7 and 10.1 mg/L in the mutant (Fig. 1b; t test, p value <0.01).
The total yields of epothilones A and B increased approximately 4.1 times, from 3.6 to 14.8 mg/L.
The results suggested that the SCE1572_25030 gene probably encoded an epothilone synthesis inhibitor (Esi).
The mutant strain was termed as So0157-2-esi-.



The presence of esi gene suppresses the epothilone production in M. xanthus

Due to the genetic manipulation difficulty in S. cellulosum cells, we investigated influences of the esi gene on the production of epothilones in M. xanthus.
We previously integrated the So0157-2 epothilone biosynthetic gene cluster randomly into M. xanthus genome by transposition; and the esi gene upstream to the epothilone gene cluster was also included in the transferred fragment [22].
We chose the ZE9 transformant derived from M. xanthus DZ2 for the assay.
Bioinformatics analysis indicated that there was no homologous sequence of esi in DZ2, which was further confirmed by PCR amplification of an esi fragment against the DZ2 genome.
Firstly, we deleted the esi gene from ZE9, producing the knockout mutant ZE9Deltaesi.
The ZE9 and ZE9Deltaesi strains had similar growth curves in CYE medium (Fig. 2a).
Methyl oleate is able to greatly increase the epothilone production ability in Myxococcus cells [39].
When fermented in the CYE medium supplemented with methyl oleate (CMO medium), the two strains showed different production abilities of epothilones.
After 6 days of incubation, the yields of epothilones A and B increased 72.4 and 24.2%, and the total yields of epothilones were 9.9 mg/L in ZE9 and 13.7 mg/L in ZE9Deltaesi, respectively (Fig. 2b).
The deletion of esi significantly increased the production of epothilones in Myxococcus cells (t test, p value <0.01).

Furthermore, we constructed an esi-overexpressing mutant strain ZE9 att::esi by using plasmid pSWU30-p630-esi to introduce an additional esi gene into the attB site of ZE9 genome.
Using the same process, the empty plasmid pSWU30-p630 was also introduced into ZE9, forming the ZE9 att::Tet strain as a control.
These two strains were inoculated in CYE medium supplemented with 5 mug/mL tetracycline for 48 h, which were used as seeds to inoculate fresh CYE medium to assay their growth curves.
The results showed that the ZE9 att::esi and ZE9 att::Tet strains also had a similar growth curve as the ZE9 strain (Fig. 2a).
However, the introduction of an additional esi gene obviously suppressed the epothilone production (9.9 mg/L in ZE9 vs. 5.5 mg/L in ZE9 att::esi; t test, p value <0.01), whereas the ZE9 att::Tet had a similar epothilone yield as ZE9 (t test, p value >0.05) (Fig. 2b).
Accordingly, Esi is a negative regulator for the production of epothilones, functioning not only in the producing Sorangium strains, but also in Myxococcus.



Esi negatively regulates the transcription of epothilone biosynthetic genes

To investigate the regulation mechanism of Esi on the production of epothilones, we comparatively analyzed the transcriptional levels of epothilone biosynthetic genes in the esi-deletion and overexpression mutants with their parent strain M. xanthus ZE9 using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR).
In ZE9 strain, compared with the expression of the epoA gene, the esi gene expressed at a low level (Fig. 3).
In the early growth stage (24 h of incubation), expression of the esi gene was approximately 21% of the epoA gene; then weakly decreased with the increase of incubation.
After the growth, the expression level of esi gene was greatly decreased, remaining less than 2% of the 24 h-expression at the 60 h of incubation (the stable stage of the growth curve, referred to Fig. 2b).
Comparatively, in the ZE9 att::esi mutant, the additional esi gene was under the control of the 630-bp promoter of pilA, which held the total expression level of esi at high levels.
The esi expressions at the 24, 48 and 60 h were 4.35-, 3.16- and 2.70-fold of that at the 24 h in the ZE9 strain (Fig. 3).

Similar to that in our previous report [22], transcriptional levels of the epothilone biosynthetic genes markedly varied in ZE9.
With the increase of incubation time, transcriptions of the seven ORFs in the gene cluster each increased approximately ten times during the growth stage from 24 to 48 h, and then rapidly decreased in the following 12 h (Fig. 3).
The transcriptional pattern was consistent with the production curves of epothilones in M. xanthus cells [22] or S. cellulosum cells [16], which was different from other microbial secondary metabolisms, usually expressed in stationary growth phase [2, 4].

After the deletion of the esi gene, the transcriptional level of each of the seven epothilone ORFs was markedly up-regulated at different incubation time points (t test, p value <0.05 or p value <0.01) (Fig. 3).
The transcriptional increases ranged from 99% (epoF) to 200% (epoC) at 24 h, 88% (epoF) to 574% (epoD) at 48 h and 124% (epoD) to 611% (epoB) at 60 h of incubation.
However, with the overexpression of esi, the epothilone genes were correspondingly down-regulated in the ZE9 att::esi strain (Fig. 3).
The above RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that Esi negatively regulated the transcription of epothilone genes.



The structure model of Esi and its potential regulation mechanism

It is known that the repression of transcription initiation often occurs simply by steric hindrance [29].
From the above results, we suggested that the esi protein product probably functioned by directly binding on the epothilone promoter sequence to block the transcription.
Esi (WP_020736929.1) is a protein with 373 amino acids in size.
Domain prediction by the SMART program showed that the protein had no signal peptide or transmembrane domain.
We constructed the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Esi protein using the I-TASSER and QUARK programs.
All the structural models were refined at the atomic level by using the fragment-guided molecular dynamics (FG-MD) simulations.
Based on the constructed model, the Esi protein contained three regions, i.e. an N-terminal domain, a linker region and a C-terminal domain, with the isoelectric points of 6.90, 5.87 and 5.95, respectively (Fig. 4a).
The 106-aa N-terminal domain had three parallel beta-pleated sheets and three alpha helixes, the 248-aa C-terminal domain was a Cupin-like domain (pfam13621), and the linker region was an alpha helix (Fig. 4b).
According to the quality assessment by Ramachandran plot (Additional file 1: Figure S1), the accuracy of protein structural models (80.6% of the residues in favored region) was acceptable [40].

The repressors, usually in dimer or further multimer form, bind to the operator sequence of promoter and thus block the transcription; and most operators contain direct or inverted repeats of a 4 - 5 base pair sequence for the binding [34].
We further constructed potential DNA - protein complex structure.
We reconstructed a 3D structure of the epothilone promoter using w3DNA, and then calculated to determine the best complex structure of Esi-promoter by using nucleic acid-protein dock (NPDock).
The results suggested that the N-terminal domain of Esi connected with the promoter DNA sequence (Fig. 4c).
We checked the promoter sequence and found a special 17-bp DNA sequence (-137 to -153 bp relative to the transcriptional start site), which contains a 4-bp inverted repeat sequence (Fig. 1a).
According to the DNA - protein complex structure, we suggested that the inverted repeat was the best Esi-binding region.
The Esi protein might work as a dimer, and the two N-terminal domains bind specifically to the inverted GGGA of the double-strand promoter DNA sequence.



Esi negatively regulates on epothilone promoter sequence

In our previous report, we revealed that a 24-bp fragment in the epothilone promoter probably played a regulation role for the RNA polymerase functions [36].
Interestingly, this fragment includes the specific inverted repeat sequence.
To determine the molecular mechanism of Esi regulation on the epothilone synthesis, we assayed the binding activity between Esi and the 17-bp operator DNA sequence of epothilone promoter.
We constructed the esi gene into the expression vector pET-28a, forming pET-28a-esi, which was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells.
The Esi protein was tagged with a 6-His sequence.
After induction with 0.1 mM IPTG, the Esi proteins were extracted from the cultivated cells, and purified based on the fused His-tag (Fig. 5a).

The double-strand 17-bp sequence was obtained by PCR annealing with the primers labeled with biotin.
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) was performed to detect the specific binding activity of Esi and the 17-bp sequence.
Each of the reaction system contained biotin-labeled DNA and LightShift (TM) Poly (dI - dC).
The results clearly showed that the His-Esi protein was able to bind to the biotin-labeled DNA.
If the molar ratio of protein and DNA was increased, the more DNA was blocked (Fig. 5b), which indicated that the His-Esi protein bound specifically with operator DNA, rather than the nonspecific competition DNA (Poly dI - dC).



Existence of esi gene in bacteria

Using the Esi amino acid sequence as a seed, we iteratively searched the homologous sequences in RefSeq database using the psi-BLAST program, and found 156 Esi-homologues with more than 90% of alignment coverage.
The genes encoding for the 156 Esi homologous proteins distributed in 203 different bacterial genomes (Additional file 2: Table S1), all belonging to the Proteobacteria.
These genomes contained single esi gene copy, except Pseudomonas fluorescens FW300-N2C3, which contained two genes encoding for the Esi homologous proteins.
The esi gene distributed mainly in Pseudomonas (143 of the 203 genomes), Acinetobacter (41 genomes) and Burkholderia (6 genomes).
Surprisingly, among more than 20 sequenced myxobacterial genomes, the esi gene was only found in the Stigmatella aurantiaca strain DW4/3-1 and the S. cellulosum strains So0157-2 and So0163.
The results indicated that the Esi regulation mechanism was not universal in myxobacteria.

All of the Esi proteins had a length ranging from 356aa to 419aa, and their functions have not been reported, indicating that the esi gene codes a novel negative regulator.
The evolutionary conservation of each amino acid residue in the Esi homologue proteins was calculated using ConSurf [41], which showed that the C-terminal domain had the highest conservation, followed by the N-terminal domain and the linker region (Additional file 3: Figure S2).
Because of high similarities of their amino acid sequences, these homologous proteins were suggested to have similar 3D structures as the Esi protein described in this paper, probably playing functions as transcriptional regulation factors like the Esi protein.
