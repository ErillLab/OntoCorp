Transcriptional response of the nitrogen metabolism genes to phosphate limitation

We previously reported that phosphate limitation upregulated nitrogen metabolism genes in the DeltaphoP mutant (23).
Microarray results showed that glutamine synthetase gene glnII and genes of the operon amtB-glnK-glnD increased their transcription in response to phosphate downshift in the DeltaphoP mutant, while no change was detected in the wild-type strain.
The GlnA protein, detected in 2D gels, was overproduced in the DeltaphoP mutant.
These expression responses suggested that PhoP might be exerting a negative effect on expression of those nitrogen metabolism genes.

Inspection of the nucleotide sequences of the promoter regions indicated the presence of PHO-like sequences in the above mentioned nitrogen structural genes and in the glnR regulator gene.
This suggested that the previously observed transcriptomic profiles were due to both direct and indirect regulation by PhoP.
The direct control was checked by DNA-binding analysis of the glnA, glnII and amtB promoters using the purified DNA-binding domain of the PhoP response regulator (GST-PhoPDBD) (8).
The promoter regions of the two regulatory genes, glnR and glnRII, were also analysed to explore a possible indirect control of the structural genes.



PhoP binds the glnR promoter but not the glnRII one

The glnR 5'-region was cloned by PCR as a fragment of 362 bp that also included 98 bp of the upstream coding sequence (CDS).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) of this fragment with the GST-PhoPDBD protein revealed the formation of three retarded bands (Figure 1).
As reported previously (11), each retarded DNA - protein complex correspond to a number of protein monomers bound to the DNA fragment.
The established model of the PhoP-binding site indicates that each PhoP monomer binds a direct repeat unit (DRu) of 11 nt.
Two or three consecutive DRus form the core of the binding site.
Once the core is occupied, further protein monomers can bind adjacent DRus, what account for the DNA - protein complexes of lower electrophoretic mobility (see the detailed analysis below).


To locate the PhoP-binding site, we carried out DNase I footprinting experiments.
Electrophoretic separation of digestion products was facilitated by using a smaller fragment of 257 bp that comprised only the glnR promoter sequence.
The GST-PhoPDBD protein at a concentration of 2 muM protected from DNase I digestion a stretch of 33 nt located at positions -139 to -107 in the coding strand (all coordinates are referred to the translation start site; Figure 2A).
This stretch comprised a DRu with sequence matching the first seven PHO box consensus bases (GTTCACC).
In addition, some upstream and downstream nucleotides were protected to a lesser extent by protein binding.
As previously observed in other PhoP footprintings (11), DNase I hypersensitive sites appeared next to the binding site at its 3'-end.
The complementary strand showed protection from -112 to -140 nt, partial protections up to position -103, and hypersensitive sites at positions -144 and -145 (Figure 2B).


The promoter region of glnR contains three transcription start sites at positions -200, -170 to -168 and -119, which correspond to promoters P3, P2 and P1, respectively (21).
Promoter P3 is active only during the exponential phase, whereas transcriptions originated from P2 and P1 promoters are detected at both exponential and stationary phases (31).
Fink et al. (19) reported that only P2 and P3 are active in conditions of nitrogen limitation.
The PhoP protection covers the distal P1 transcription start (Figure 3A).
Thus, binding of PhoP probably blocks the glnR expression whatever promoter is active.


Although computer searches of the promoter region of the second nitrogen regulatory gene glnRII did not reveal any conserved PHO DRu, we examined it for PhoP binding.
Even at 1 muM of protein, the EMSA results did not show any binding under conditions identical to those used for glnR (Figure 1; see 'Discussion' section).



PhoP-binding sites overlap the GlnR boxes in both glutamine synthetase genes glnA and glnII

The 5' sequences of the two glutamine synthetase genes of S. coelicolor were amplified by PCR.
The cloned glnA fragment comprised the intergenic sequence (-220 to +16) and 36 bp of the upstream opposite CDS.
The glnII fragment contained the full promoter region of 136 bp plus the last 105 bp of the upstream CDS.
Both fragments were able to bind PhoP since they gave shifted bands in EMSA.

The glnAp gave a clear shifted band and a weak one of lower electrophoretic mobility (I and II, respectively; Figure 1).
The footprinting assay of the glnA coding strand revealed a protected region extending from -142 to -114 and partial protection of nucleotides -111 and -110 (Figure 2C).
The same region was protected in the complementary strand, from -142 to -108, although a hypersensitive site was evident at nucleotide -113 (Figure 2D).
This protected region comprises the first and half of the second GlnR box that have been described in the glnA promoter (22).
The GlnR boxes have been defined as composed of two conserved sequences of 5 nt separated by 6 variable nt (22) (see also Figure 3B - E).
GlnR function as a transcriptional activator of glnA (19,22).
Binding of PhoP at the glnA promoter region is likely to interfere with GlnR binding and possibly with RNA polymerase function since the glnA transcription start site is located at position -74 (20) (Figure 3B).

The gel mobility shift assays of the glnII promoter revealed three clear DNA - protein complexes.
Complexes II and III showed stronger retardation (lower mobility) than complex I, and also showed a higher signal intensity (Figure 1).

As shown in Figure 2E and F, the GST-PhoPDBD protein protected a large nt stretch of the glnII promoter from DNase I digestion, extending from -145 to -88 in the coding strand, and from -138 to -84 in the complementary strand.
In contrast to the glnA sequence, the coding strand of glnII exhibited a well-conserved DRu (Figure 3D).
Also, the large protected nt stretch completely covers the two GlnR boxes described by Tiffert et al. (22).
Two closely placed promoters have been described in the glnII gene.
The main promoter should correspond to the major vegetative sigma factor and its transcription start site is the adenine -79.
The minor promoter shows putative elements of sigma31 (14).
This sigma factor, which is more active at stationary phase, recognizes promoters of actIII (an actinorhodin structural gene) and of hrdD (a homologue of Escherichia coli rpoD), and also the glnR P2 promoter (31).
As shown in Figure 3D, the overlapping location of promoters and binding sites indicate that PhoP may repress glnII transcription interfering with both GlnR binding and promoter activity.



The promoter for the amtB-glnK-glnD operon contains separated PhoP and GlnR operators

The amtB gene encodes a putative ammonium transporter and forms an operon with glnK and glnD, which encode the PII protein and the PII nucleotidyl transferase respectively (18,19).
The latter two proteins may be considered nitrogen metabolism sensors.
Using RT - PCR experiments and a glnR mutant, Tiffert et al. (22) showed that GlnR activates the transcription of the amtB gene.

EMSA analyses of the DNA fragment containing the amtB 5'-region (-285 to +4) showed a clear shifted band and a second weak one with lower mobility (Figure 1).
The DNase I protection of this fragment extended from -186 to -152 in the coding strand what contained a conserved DRu (Figure 2G).
Results for the complementary strand showed a protected stretch from -142 to -170, and partial protection of the nucleotides -175 and -177 (Figure 2H).

In contrast to what we have found for the GS genes, the PhoP-binding site at the amtB promoter is placed upstream and separated from the GlnR boxes (Figure 3E).
Three separated promoters (P3 to P1) have been identified in the amtB upstream region by low resolution S1 analysis (19).
In principle, the location of the P1 transcription start site (-76 to -73, Figure 3E) suggests that PhoP does not control this promoter but the upstream ones P3 and P2.
In this case PhoP might act as a 'road-block' preventing the expression from the upstream promoters.



Analysis of the complex operator structures

The PhoP-binding sites are formed by direct repeats units (DRu) of 11 nt, each one bound by a protein monomer.
We have recently described the structures of DRus based on the 'information theory' analysis and on combined EMSA and footprinting results (11).
The differentiated structures served to classify the PHO operators into three groups.
Operators that produce a unique retarded band in EMSA are either class I, if formed by 2 DRus (i.e. one PHO box), or class II, if composed of three DRus.
More frequently (as occurs in all cases reported here) PhoP binding produces two or more retarded bands in EMSA.
Those sites belong to class III and comprise two or three conserved DRus that form the core of the site, and one or several DRus that extend the protein occupancy beyond the core.

Figure 3 includes the summary of the footprinting results.
The protected regions were analysed by the sequence walker method (29) using the Model 1 matrix (11).
In each walker, the letter height represents the conservation of the base and its contribution to the information content of the site (Ri value).
Base conservation correlates with the number of contacts to the protein (32), and, when displayed as walkers, serves to identify the binding sequence.

The protected region in the glnR promoter comprised three DRus, and a partially protected fourth one (Figure 3A).
The proposed DRu structure explains the formation of the three observed complexes in EMSA (Figure 1).
A similar operator structure was observed in the phytase gene (SCO7697) (11).

The PhoP-binding site in the glnA promoter showed a less evident interpretation.
In the coding strand a class II structure was suggested.
This implies that the glnAp fragment should yield a unique retarded complex.
Nevertheless, a second faint band appeared above the major retarded band in EMSA (Figure 1).
Moreover, the highest conserved DRu is poorly protected, and the total Ri for this structure is negative (-1.3 bits, Figure 3B).
When an accurate binding model is used, it has been demonstrated that the Ri value must be positive (29).
In the complementary strand a more plausible structure was found because the core sequences show a low but positive Ri (0.2 bits), they were completely protected, and the two retarded bands can be explained (Figure 3C).
The large protected sequence in the glnII promoter included five DRus (Figure 3D) that account for the formation of the three EMSA complexes.

The PhoP protected region in the amtB promoter covered a well conserved DRu that is flanked by two poorly conserved DRus.
The two observed EMSA complexes indicate a structure composed of a 2 DRu core plus an extension repeat.
The degree of protection and the walkers served us to decide which of the flanking DRus forms part of the core (Figure 3E).



Reporter studies: PhoP represses the transcription of nitrogen genes

In order to quantify the effect of PhoP on expression of the nitrogen-regulated genes, glnR, glnA, glnII and amtB promoter regions were cloned in pLUXAR+neo driving expression of the luxAB reporter gene.
The resulting integrative plasmids pAR-N2 (glnRp), pAR-N4 (glnAp), pAR-N6 (glnIIp), pAR-N8 (amtBp) were introduced by conjugation into the wild-type M145 strain and into the INB201 (DeltaphoP) mutant.
Plasmids are stably maintained by integration into the Streptomyces chromosome PhiC31 attB site.

Cultures were grown in MG-3.2 medium (containing 3.2 mM phosphate), using three independent replicates.
The cultures showed a diauxic growth with transition phase from 45 to 51 h that triggered the onset of antibiotic production; the DeltaphoP mutant showed reduced growth as described in Santos-Beneit et al. (25).

Using these reporter constructions it was clearly observed that the four promoter regions were repressed by PhoP since reporter enzyme higher activities were observed in the DeltaphoP mutant with respect to parental strain at all sampling times (Figure 4A - D).
The reporter expression patterns, varied among the promoters assayed.
Thus, compared to the other assayed promoters (of phosphate transporter genes pstS, pitH1 and pitH2, and of glycerophosphodiesterase genes glpQ1 and glpQ2) [(23,25), Santos-Beneit, unpublished] the promoter region of the glnR gene produced usual or low activities across the time course of the culture.
Indeed, in the wild-type strain the luminescence signals were below the instrument detection limit at 70 h (Figure 4A).
In contrast, the structural glnA, glnII and amtB genes appeared to have very strong promoters.
Among these, glnIIp showed the highest activities in the wild-type strain.
Besides, maximum activities of the different promoters were reached at distinct growth phases.
In both strains glnRp activities increased until the transition phase (45 h, Figure 4A), and decreased thereafter.
For the glnA and amtB promoter activities, the highest values were at the exponential growth phase in the wild-type (35 h, Figure 4B and D).
The glnIIp showed high activities during the first growth phase and a maximum activity at 42 h (at the initial transition phase, Figure 4C).
In all cases, the wild-type activities dropped rapidly after the transition phase resulting in low values in the stationary phase.
In contrast, deletion of the phoP gene caused slower promoter activity drops, as seen in the INB201 plots (Figure 4A - D).


In summary, we can conclude that PhoP represses directly the transcription of GS genes glnA, glnII, the putative ammonium transporter gene amtB, and the nitrogen regulatory genes glnD and glnK, which form part of the amtB operon.
In addition, PhoP negatively controls these genes via repression of its activator gene glnR.
