Results and Discussion:

In this study, the presence of major known bacterial virulence factors in Sphingomonas wittichii was investigated.
Phylogenetic relationships among 74 species of genus Sphingomonas, including the human pathogen Sphingomonas paucimobilis were reconstructed.
Figure 1 shows the Partial 16SrDNA based Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree for all 74 species of the genus Sphingomonas.
This figure also shows that Sphingomonas wittichii is a relatively close taxon to S. starnbergensis, S. histidinilytica, S. parapaucimobilis, S. yabuuchiae and the human pathogen S. paucimobilis.
The pair wise genetic distance analysis was performed which showed the overall value of distance analysis among Sphingomonas species to be 0.05.
The individual values of pairwise distance between of S. wittichii with S.sanguinis, S. histidinilytica, S. parapaucimobilis, S. paucimobilis, S. yabuuchiae and the distantly related species S. mali were 0.016, 0.026, 0.048, 0.042, 0.042 and 0.06 (Supporting information Table 1) respectively.
The S. starnbergensis is a novel type of freshwater bacterium isolated from the prealpine mesotrophic Starnberger See (Bavaria, southern Germany).
This species showed 95.3 % sequence similarity with S. paucimobilis DSM 1098(T), the type species of the genus Sphingomonas [14].
While, the S. histidinilytica was isolated from an open hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) dump site at Ummari village in Lucknow, India.
It showed 16S rDNA similarity of 99.4 %, with Sphingomonas wittichii DSM 6014(T) [15].
Moreover, S. yabuuchiae was identified from samples taken from the Russian space laboratory Mir.
As shown in our results (Figure 1), S. yabuuchiae 16S rDNA sequence formed a coherent cluster with Sphingomonas sanguinis, Sphingomonas parapaucimobilis, Sphingomonas paucimobilis and Sphingomonas roseiflava with sequence similarity of 97-5 - 98-6% [16].
Sphingomonas wittichii also came in a coherent cluster with S. parapaucimobilis and S. paucimobilis, the only two species that are considered of human clinical significance [17].


The Maximum Likelihood method was used to construct a phylogenetic tree using partial 16S rDNA sequences of selected pathogenic bacteria as mentioned above in (Figure 2) and this was specifically done in order to make a guided decision for the choice of pathogenic bacteria species that will be used in the following comparative genomics analysis with Sphingomonas wittichii.
This phylogenetic tree showed that Brucella sp. was the closest bacterial taxon to Sphingomonas, followed by Helicobacter spp., Campylobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp., and then Legionella sp.
Based on these suggested phylogenetic relationships, the following bacterial species, Brucella sp., Helicobacter sp., Campylobacter sp., Pseudomonas sp. and Legionella sp, were selected for further comparative genomic and bioinformatics analysis.


Table 1 shows the selected bacterial genera with its corresponding species, hosts, and the diseases.
All the chosen pathogens were mainly human, animal, protozoa, and plants pathogens.
(Table 2) shows the virulent factors acquired by the chosen pathogens that were tested for its presence in S. wittichii genomic information.
The major categories of bacterial virulence factors include adherence, endotoxin production, adherence, mobility, secretion systems and quorum sensing.


Table 3 and Figure 3 presents the shared virulence factors among S. wittichii and the selected five bacterial pathogens.
Results in Table 3 showed that S. wittichii shares the genes accountable for intracellular survival capability (manC and pgm) with Brucella sp. with e-values ranging from 0 to 3.00E-09 [11,12,13].
In addition, Sphingomonas spp., shares the genes encoding for Type IV secretion system such as BMEII0026 with Brucella sp. with e-value of 6.00E-04 and identity similarity of 90%.
On the contrary, S. wittichii does not share any virulence factors with Helicobacter spp. or Campylobacter sp. despite their close phylogenetic relationship.
Moreover, S. wittichii shared Legionella sp. genes accountable for adherence and motility, namely, htpB and flip.
In addition, S. wittichii and Legionella sp. shared the gene responsible for stress tolerance and sodB.
The sodB encodes for superoxide dismutase which is a cytoplasmic iron superoxide dismutase important for intracellular survival and transmission [18].


Notwithstanding of the phylogenetic divergence between S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp., it was noticed that they share several major virulence factors such as, adherence antiphagocytosis, iron uptake, proteases, quorum sensing.
S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. shared 19 genes of flagella formation (adherence) including flgK with e-value of 1.00E-04 and identity similarity of 94% and flgF with e-value of 6.00E-05 and identity similarity of 89%.
The Flagella formation plays an important role as a virulence factor that enable motility toward the infection site, biofilm formation and several other pathogenic adaptations [19,20,21,22,23].
Moreover, S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. shared many genes implicated in type IV pili biogenesis and mechanical function of pili, such as fimU with e-value of 3.00E-04 and pilB with e-value of 3.00E-04 and 93% identity similarity.
The type IV pili system plays an important role in adherence by assisting the pathogens to attach with their host cells and the twitching motility that allows the bacteria to move along the cell surface and in biofilm formation [20, 24,25,26,27,28].
Moreover, they shared two genes waaG and waaP implicated in lipopolysaccharide production that also play role in adherence ability.
Additionally, S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. share many genes implicated in antiphagocytosis through alginate production.
They shared six alginate genes including algJ with e-value of 7.00E-04 and identity similarity of 94% and alg44 with e-value of 7.00E-04 and identity similarity of 85%.
Alginate production allows pathogens to form bacterial biofilms and contributes to the persistence of bacteria in the lung by acting as an adhesin, which prevents the bacteria from being expelled from the infection site.
The alginate slime layer makes it more difficult for phagocytes to ingest and kill the bacteria [29,30,31,32,33].


Another important bacterial virulence factor shared between S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. is quorum-sensing ability.
S. wittichii has both rhlL and rhlR with e-values of 3.00E-4 and 5.00E-9, respectively.
Thus S. wittichii possess only rhl system of quorum sensing.
Whilst in Pseudomonas sp. quorum sensing consists of two separate but interrelated systems, namely; las and rhl which are found to regulate the production of multiple virulence factors and are also crucial for proper biofilm formation [34,35,36].
In addition, S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. share seven genes encoding for xcp secretion system (Type II secretion system) including xcpX and xcpR with e-values of 1.00E-5 and 3.00E-174, respectively.
The xcp secretion system is found to be responsible for secretion of toxins and enzymes into the extracellular fluid [37,38].
It was also observed that both S. wittichii and Pseudomonas sp. share several genes involved in Iron uptake using both Pyochelin (10 genes) and Pyoverdine (4 genes).
The Pyochelin is effective at enhancing iron uptake in P. aeruginosa, catalyzes the formation of tissue-damaging free radicals and also binds other transition metals (e.g. Mo (IV), Co (II)) with appreciable affinity and is also implicated in the delivery of both Co (II) and Mo (IV) to P. aeruginosa cells [39,40].
The Pyoverdine is effective at acquiring iron from Transferrin and Lactoferrin.
Moreover, Pyoverdine is cytotoxic due to its ability to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species [41,42].


Since production of bacterial toxins is very important aspect of virulence, we extended our comparative analysis in order to investigate the presence of toxin related genes in S. wittichii.
Table 2 shows toxins that were found to share between S. wittichii and Bordetella pertussis, the strictly aerobic Gram-negative coccobacilli pathogen.
B. pertussis is a strict human pathogen causing whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory disease marked by severe, spasmodic coughing episodes [43,44,45].
It was also observed that S. wittichii contains genes for Invasive Adenylate cyclase /haemolysin, cyclolysin secretion protein which is a bi-functional toxin harboring both adenylate cyclase and hemolytic activities and functions primarily as an antiinflammatory factor [46,47,48].
Moreover, Sphingomonas spp. contains genes responsible for Pertussis toxin and its secretion system which assists in the attachment of B. pertussis to ciliated respiratory cells, important immunogen and activate cyclic Adenosine Phosphate (cAMP), Histamine Sensitising Factor (HSF), Lymphocytosis Promoting Factor (LPF), Islet-activating protein (IAP), interferes with leucocyte function and is haemolytic [49,50,51][52,53].


Results of this study showed that S. wittichii contains several major virulence factors mainly resembling Pseudomonas sp. 
Other virulence factors from Legionella sp., Brucella sp. and Bordetella sp., have also been observed.
Moreover, the similarity of virulence factors did not correspond to the phylogenetic relationships.
These findings suggest horizontal gene transfer of virulence factors rather than sharing a common pathogenic ancestor.
The other possible scenario is that S. wittichii went through a reductive evolution process that attenuated its pathogenic capabilities.
In both cases we suggest that lots of care must be taken when releasing S. wittichii higher concentrations in the process environmental remediation.
