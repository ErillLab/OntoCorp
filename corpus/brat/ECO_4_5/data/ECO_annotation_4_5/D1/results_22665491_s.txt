The Expression of the H2-T6SS Genes Is Controlled by Quorum Sensing

Although the H1-T6SS cluster is repressed by RetS/Gac signaling system in PAO1, the H2-T6SS and H3-T6SS are not (3, 24 - 26).
To probe the transcriptional regulation of the H2-T6SS gene cluster, we analyzed the DNA region upstream of the first gene, hsiA2 (PA1656), of the cluster in PAO1 (Fig. 1A).
Two sigma70-dependent promoters were predicted in the intergenic region between the upstream gene (PA1655) and hsiA2 (PA1656) by the BProm program (Fig. 1B).
We created a lacZ transcriptional fusion in which the DNA region upstream of the ATG of the first gene of the H2-T6SS cluster was fused to lacZ and integrated at the CTX phage attB site as a single copy on the chromosome, yielding strain PAO1TS2.
Strain PAO1Z was similarly constructed by integrating a promoter-less lacZ gene to serve as a negative control (Table 1).
The beta-galactosidase activity profile associated with the transcriptional fusion indicated that the H2-T6SS gene cluster expression was low during the exponential phase but increased at 3 h of growth in TSB medium at 37 degrees C, during the log to stationary phase transition (Fig. 2A).
The expression was at its highest (10-fold above background) in stationary phase, whereas promoter activity was undetectable in the control strain PAO1Z.

The biphasic, cell density-dependent expression profile of the reporter fusion suggested that the transcription of H2-T6SS might be regulated by QS.
This could be in agreement with the regulation by LasR of the PA14 hcp2 gene, which lacks in PAO1 (19).
We therefore examined H2-T6SS expression in P. aeruginosa QS mutants.
Two homoserine lactone-mediated QS systems, the Las and Rhl systems, have been described in P. aeruginosa (27).
The transcriptional regulators LasR and RhlR are activated by their cognate autoinducers, N-(3-oxododecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone and N-(butanoyl)-l-HSL (C4-HSL) produced by the LasI and RhlI synthases, respectively.
The pTS2 fusion was integrated on the chromosome of a lasR mutant (PAOR) (28) and that of a rhlI mutant (PDO100) (29) creating PAORTS2 and PDO100TS2 QS mutant strains.
Compared with wild type PAO1, the expression of H2-T6SS was significantly delayed in the two QS mutants, becoming detectable 6 h post-inoculation, with maximal levels decreased 22- and 8.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2B).
Complementation in trans of the lasR mutation in PAORTS2 with pBLasR, a plasmid constitutively producing LasR, affected the growth of the strain (the strain stops growing at A600 = 2.5) but restored the fusion activity almost to its wild type levels at the exponential phase (filled circles in Fig. 2B).
N-Acylhomoserine lactone synthase mutants, such as rhlI, can be phenotypically complemented by addition of the corresponding N-acylhomoserine lactone (30, 31).
The addition of the C4-HSL (10 mum) to the rhlI mutant PDO100TS2 restored induction of the expression at the transition phase of growth, and the expression was 4-fold higher than in the mutant (Fig. 2B).
One can note that the decrease in H2-T6SS expression observed with the lasR mutant is greater (2.6-fold) than with the rhlI mutant.
This may imply a direct effect of LasR, as well as an indirect effect mediated through Rhl system.

Thus to confirm a direct effect of RhlR-C4-HSL on H2-T6SS expression too, the H2-T6SS promoter region was cloned into pMP220 to generate a plasmid borne lacZ transcriptional fusion whose expression was quantified in a strain of E. coli, which harbored IPTG-inducible copies of rhlR and rhlI.
Upon RhlR and RhlI production, a 3.3-fold up-regulation of the H2-T6SS promoter region was observed (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the Rhl system is sufficient for the induction of H2-T6SS expression.

The promoter region of QS regulated genes in P. aeruginosa usually contains a Las-Rhl box, a 20-bp repeat located approximately between 60 and 40 bp from the start of transcription (32, 33).
As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), a putative Las-Rhl box can be identified in the upstream region of the H2-T6SS gene cluster, but far from the two predicted promoters.
Using 5' rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends PCR, we located a transcription initiation site 246 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon of the hsiA2 gene (the +1 position is indicated in gray in Fig. 1B).
We were thus able to position -10 and -35 boxes of a sigma70 promoter in proximity of the Las-Rhl box centered at -47 with respect to the transcript start site.
Together, our studies support the notion that the expression of the P. aeruginosa H2-T6SS genes appears to be directly controlled by the Las and Rhl QS systems.



H2-T6SS Gene Expression Is Induced in Iron-limiting Conditions and Regulated by Fur

For many pathogens, the host environment is often iron poor, which triggers the expression of a group of genes transcriptionally regulated by iron through the ferric uptake regulator protein Fur.
In addition to its role in iron homeostasis, Fur is involved in the coordinate regulation of numerous virulence genes.
In the case of P. aeruginosa, Fur regulates exotoxin A and alkaline protease production (34, 35), as well as biofilm formation (36).
We noted the presence of a sequence upstream of the H2-T6SS gene cluster that conformed to the E. coli and P. aeruginosa consensus Fur binding sequence (GATAATGATAATCATTATC) (37, 38) or the (NATWAT)3 sequence proposed as the E. coli Fur box (39) (Fig. 1, B and D).
The two putative Fur boxes overlapped with the -10 box of the two predicted sigma70 promoters, suggesting that Fur binding at this position in presence of iron prevents RNA polymerase binding to the -10 box and thus represses transcription.
To test this, PAO1TS2, which harbored the H2-T6SS-lacZ transcriptional fusion, was grown in TSB in presence of the iron chelator 2,2'-bipyridyl (250 mum).
The activity of the promoter was induced 2.2-fold in these conditions (Fig. 2D).

To determine whether Fur is required for H2-T6SS regulation and because Fur seems to be essential for P. aeruginosa viability (40), the expression of the plasmid borne transcriptional fusion was studied in an E. coli WT and isogenic fur mutant.
After 4 h of growth, the activity of the fusion increased by 2.6-fold in the Fur mutant (Fig. 2E).
Together, these data suggest that transcription of the H2-T6SS gene cluster is induced under iron-limiting conditions, an environment that the pathogen encounters in the human host.



H2-T6SS Contributes to P. aeruginosa Internalization in Non-phagocytic Cells

Although P. aeruginosa is considered an extracellular pathogen, it is able to measurably enter (i.e., invade) normally nonphagocytic cells ((41), for a review see Ref.77).
To address the potential role of H2-T6SS in P. aeruginosa internalization, we constructed a nonpolar mutant in the AAA+ ATPase ClpV2 whose homologue was shown to play a crucial role in the functionality of the H1-T6SS system (3, 42).
We verified that the mutation does not affect the growth of the strain, nor the major adhesins of P. aeruginosa (flagellum and type IV pili), nor the secretion of ExoS, an anti-internalization factor (supplemental Fig. S1).
Moreover, adhesion of the clpV2 mutant was unaffected (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B).
We then compared invasion of transition phase grown wild type PAO1 with a mutant defective in H2-T6SS (PAO1DeltaclpV2), using a standard antibiotic protection assay adapted from Ref.
43.
As shown in Fig. 3A, PAO1 was able to invade nonphagocytic cells, with an average of 1.7% of adherent bacteria internalized (supplemental Fig. S2C), whereas PAO1DeltaclpV2 entry into host cells was reduced by ~75%.
Invasion was restored to wild type levels in the complemented clpV2 mutant (Fig. 3A).

Because we previously observed a cell density expression pattern of H2-T6SS genes, we asked whether the growth phase of the bacteria impacts the internalization capacity.
Although exponential grown clpV2 mutant bacteria were less internalized (~75% reduction as with transition phase bacteria; data not shown), stationary phase bacteria were internalized at the same level as the wild type strain (supplemental Fig. S3).

Even if P. aeruginosa escapes the normal bactericidal mechanisms of epithelial cells, it only poorly replicates in A549 pneumocytes (41) or in corneal epithelial cells (43).
Given the length of the infection in the invasion assay (5 h including the gentamicin treatment), to examine the possibility of an intracellular replication and/or persistence defect of the clpV2 mutant, we compared the number of intracellular bacteria after 2.5 and 5.5 h of infection for each strain.
After allowing 3 h for bacterial replication, we observed the same range of data (between 4.9- and 6-fold increase) for all the strains (Fig. 3B).
In conclusion, the H2-T6SS mutant displays an invasion defect.

In a complementary assay, HeLa cells were infected with GFP-labeled P. aeruginosa and visualized by laser confocal microscopy (data not shown).
Few bacteria were found in HeLa cells infected with the wild type PAO1.
Conversely no bacteria were found in cells infected with the clpV2 mutant.
Together, these results support the assertion that the H2-T6SS system stimulates internalization of P. aeruginosa into HeLa cells.



Akt Phosphorylation upon Bacterial Invasion of Polarized Epithelial Cells Is Dependent on H2-T6SS

We further explored H2-T6SS-dependent bacterial entry into a more physiologically relevant cell line, Calu-3 cells, which are derived from human lung alveolar cells and which form polarized monolayers when grown on Transwell filters.
P. aeruginosa binding to polarized epithelial cells activates a central host signaling molecule, PI3K, which is required for phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate synthesis and for activation of a downstream effector, the protein kinase B/Akt (Akt) (44, 45).
Activation of the PI3K/phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate/Akt pathway was shown to be necessary and sufficient for P. aeruginosa entry from the apical surface (44).
This event leads to a remarkable remodeling of the apical membrane in which protrusions enriched for phosphatidylinositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and actin form at the apical surface at the site of bacterial entry (46).
To determine whether the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is required during the H2-T6SS-dependent uptake of P. aeruginosa by lung epithelial cells, polarized human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells were infected in the presence or absence of LY294002 (LY), a PI3K inhibitor, and adhesion, internalization, and Akt phosphorylation were determined.
Although the treatment with LY did not affect bacterial adhesion, it reduced invasion of both PAO1 and the complemented PAO1DeltaclpV2 mutant in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A).
Internalization levels of the clpV2 mutant were lower than that of PAO1 or the complemented clpV2 mutant; thus, LY treatment had little effect on the ability of the clpV2 mutant to enter host cells (Fig. 4A).

We next determined whether Akt is activated in an H2-T6SS dependent manner, as determined by phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473.
Polarized Calu-3 cells were co-cultivated with PAO1, clpV2 mutant, or the complemented clpV2 mutant.
At 60 min after infection, Akt was immunoprecipitated followed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-AktSer473 antibody.
The ratio of phospho-Akt to total Akt was quantified and normalized to the ratio observed in untreated cells.
Infection with the clpV2 mutant resulted in ~50% decrease in Akt phosphorylation levels compared with infection with PAO1 or with the complemented mutant (Fig. 4, B and C).
The magnitude of the decrease in Akt phosphorylation was similar to the magnitude of the decrease in internalization by the clpV2 mutant (Fig. 4, B and C).
LY treatment decreased Akt phosphorylation upon infection with any strain to levels observed in uninfected Calu-3 cells (Fig. 4, B and C).
Together, these data suggest that H2-T6SS stimulates bacterial entry of transition phase-grown bacteria through the PI3K/Akt pathway.



H2-T6SS Contributes to P. aeruginosa Virulence in C. elegans

The involvement of H2-T6SS in P. aeruginosa pathogenicity led us to test its role in virulence on C. elegans.
Previous studies have shown that C. elegans is a good model in which to identify P. aeruginosa virulence genes important for mammalian pathogenesis (47, 48).
In a modified slow killing assay, we observed that the clpV2 mutant was significantly less virulent than the PAO1 strain (Fig. 5), indicating that H2-T6SS plays a role in P. aeruginosa virulence.
