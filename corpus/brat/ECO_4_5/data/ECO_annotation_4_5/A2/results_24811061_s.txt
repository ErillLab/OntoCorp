Prediction of Fur boxes in the genome of N. gonorrhoeae FA1090

Construction of the IRIS chips required a set of double strand DNA probes containing target sequences.
To design the dsDNA probes, we first predicted Fur binding sequences (Fur boxes) throughout the genome using a bioinformatics approach.
Neisseria Fur boxes previously defined by DNase I foot printing studies were utilized to avoid the mismatches caused by the species-specific nucleotides in Fur boxes of different bacteria (Table S1).
A total of 198 Fur boxes in the intergenic regions throughout the gonococcal genome were predicted in this study (Table S5).
Due to the fact that transcription of Fur regulated genes responds to iron availability, we focused on the iron-regulated genes identified via microarray analyses [50], [51] of N. gonorrhoeae cultured under iron-replete and iron-deplete conditions.
Forty-five iron-repressed genes with predicted Fur boxes in their promoter regions (Table S3) were identified, which included 18 out of 21 of the previously identified Fur-repressed genes/operons in N. gonorrhoeae[52].
This consistency validated our prediction of Fur binding sequences in the gonococcal genome.
Twenty-two Fur binding sequences were predicted in the promoter regions of 21 iron-induced genes in this study (Table 1) including 2 previously identified Fur-activated genes, NGO0711 and NGO1751 [8].



Interactions of Fur with predicted consensus sequences in N. gonorrhoeae

We next characterized in vitro binding of the Fur protein to predicted Fur boxes in the promoter regions of iron-induced genes using our high-throughput, label-free technology-IRIS.
As shown in Figure 1A, Fur binding to the probes containing a predicted Fur box demonstrated a concentration dependent increase in differential spot height (DSH).
The Fur boxes in the promoter regions of fur, norB and nspA, which have different binding affinities to Fur (26.1 nM, 1.2 nM and 724.8 nM, respectively) were utilized as positive controls and the sequences in the aniA promoter as a negative control [8].
EMSA previously demonstrated that while the aniA gene contains a predicated Fur box, the Fur protein does not bind to this region [8].
Consistently, Fur binding to the known Fur boxes in fur and norB promoter regions reached 4.8 +- 0.5 and 5.4 +- 0.9 nm increase in differential spot height, respectively, when 200 nM Fur protein was added (Figure 1A).
These mass density increases corresponded to 3.8 and 3.6 Fur dimers binding to one dsDNA molecule, respectively (Figure 1B).
The differential spot height of the nspA Fur box probe continued to increase with Fur protein concentrations from 2.8 +- 0.4 nm, 3.5 +- 0.1 nm to 4.4 +- 0.1 nm (Figure 1A).
Two Fur dimers, 2.6 dimers and 3.0 dimers/nspA Fur box were detected when 200 nM, 400 nM and 800 nM Fur protein were added to the chips, respectively (Figure 1B).
As the negative control, the aniA promoter sequences showed a small mass density increase for the three concentrations of Fur protein (DSH<1 nm) (Figure 1A).
Therefore, we defined a threshold value for a DSH of GTEQ 1 nm as a cutoff for determining specific Fur binding to dsDNA probes.

According to the above analytical criteria, a large number of tested predicted Fur boxes (14 out of 18) in the promoter regions of iron-induced gonococcal genes displayed specific binding properties to the Fur protein, while 4 predicted Fur boxes failed to bind to Fur.
Specifically, NGO1683 and NGO1745 did not show increased DSH for any concentration of Fur protein (Figure 1A).
The DSHs of predicted Fur boxes in NGO302 and NGO0377 promoter regions were only ~1 nm (1.0 +- 0.06 nm and 1.0 +- 0.02 nm, respectively) when 800 nM Fur protein was added (Figure 1A), suggesting that these two predicted sequences did not bind to Fur according to the defined criteria.
In contrast, the other 14 predicted Fur boxes showed variable binding properties to Fur.
The predicted Fur boxes in the NGO0436 and NGO1738 promoter region displayed DSH values of 1.4 +- 0.05 nm and 2.0 +- 0.2 nm, respectively when 800 nM Fur was added (Figure 1A), corresponding to 0.8 dimer/dsDNA molecule and 1.6 Fur dimers/dsDNA molecule, respectively (Figure 1B).
When 400 nM Fur was added, the predicted Fur boxes in the promoter regions of NGO1284, NGO1845 and NGO1948 showed DSH values of 1.7 +- 0.03 nm, 1.7 +- 0.3 nm and 1.7 +- 0.07 nm, respectively, which all corresponded to 0.5 Fur dimers/dsDNA molecule (half amount of dsDNA is bound by Fur dimers) (Figure 1A and B).
The Fur boxes in the promoter regions of NGO0155, NGO0304, NGO0899 and NGO1189 had DSH values of 1.9 +- 0.1 nm, 2.0 +- 0.1 nm, 2.2 +- 0.1 nm and 2.0 +- 0.03 nm, respectively (Figure 1A).
These DSH values corresponded to approximately one Fur dimer/dsDNA molecule (Figure 1B).
When 200 nM Fur was added, the predicted Fur boxes in NGO0101, NGO0641 and NGO1419 promoter regions had DSH values of 1.9 +- 0.4 nm, 2.0 +- 0.1 nm and 1.9 +- 0.4 nm, respectively which correlated to one Fur dimer/dsDNA (Figure 1A and B).
The two highest binding affinities were observed for predicted Fur boxes in NGO0073 and NGO1957 promoter regions.
When 200 nM Fur was added, DSH values of these two Fur boxes were 3.5 +- 0.4 nm and 2.9 +- 0.1 nm, respectively, corresponding to 3 Fur dimers and 1.5 Fur dimers/dsDNA molecule, respectively (Figure 1A and B).

To further validate Fur binding properties of the predicted Fur boxes characterized with IRIS, we performed traditional EMSA on two of the newly identified Fur bound probes, NGO0073 and NGO0101.
Fur binding to the predicted Fur boxes in NGO0073 and NGO0101 promoter regions was specific as determined by a cold competition assay (Figure 2A).
Consistent with the binding affinity trend estimated using IRIS, the apparent KD's of Fur binding to Fur boxes of fur gene, NGO0073 and NGO0101 calculated using EMSA results were 31.8 +- 7.9 nM, 39.8 +- 6.3 nM and 406.1 +- 144.8 nM, respectively (Figure 2B).
The combination of these results supports IRIS as an accurate method to determine the specificity and affinity of Fur binding to an array of immobilized dsDNA sequences.

Of interest among the 18 tested predicted Fur boxes in the promoter regions of iron-induced genes, fourteen were shown to bind to Fur specifically in vitro (Table 1).
No information about Fur binding to these promoter regions was known previously, highlighting the power of IRIS in identifying novel promoters bound by Fur.



New targets directly regulated by Fur

We next examined the regulatory role of Fur in transcription of iron-induced genes containing a functional Fur box in the promoter regions using quantitative RT-PCR of N. gonorrhoeae wild type, fur mutant, and fur complemented strains.
This analysis revealed 5 new Fur regulated genes [NGO0155, NGO0436, NGO0641, NGO1738 and NGO1957] (Figure 3, Table 1).
An iron bound Fur-repressed gene, fbpA[6], [53], was used as a control for Fur and iron regulation.
We observed a statistically significant increase (5-fold) in fbpA transcript levels in the fur mutant strain grown under iron-replete conditions as compared to the wild type strain grown under iron-replete conditions.
AS expected we observed restoration of Fur mediated repression in the fur complemented strain (Figure 3).
Transcription of NGO0155 was up-regulated in the fur mutant strain compared to the wild type strain under iron-replete (+Fe) conditions, and was partially restored in the fur complemented strain (Figure 3), suggesting that iron-bound Fur directly represses transcription of NGO0155.
Transcriptional levels of NGO0436 and NGO1738 were reduced in the fur mutant strain compared to those in the wild type strain and partially restored in the fur complemented strain grown under iron-replete conditions (Figure 3), suggesting that NGO0436 and NGO1738 are directly activated by iron-bound Fur.
Transcription levels of NGO0641 and NGO1957 were up-regulated in the fur mutant strain compared to the wild type strain under iron-deplete conditions (-Fe) and were restored in the fur complemented strain (Figure 3).
This transcriptional pattern was similar to that previously observed in apo-Fur mediated repression [15], [16].

Transcriptional levels of nine genes, NGO0073, NGO0101 (Figure 3), NGO0304, NGO0899, NGO1189, NGO1284, NGO1419, NGO1845 and NGO1948, showed no difference in expression among the three strains (Table 1, Figure S2).
This suggests that these genes are not regulated by Fur under the growth conditions in this study.
However, due to the fact that Fur specifically binds to promoter regions of these genes with high affinities, we termed this phenomenon "silent Fur binding" in N. gonorrhoeae.
