Phenotypical characterization of scoC deletion mutant

A scoC deletion mutant strain (BA06-del-scoC) was successfully disrupted by homologous recombination following the strategy as showed in Fig.1 and confirming by colony PCR and DNA sequencing (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
Furthermore, an overexpression strain (del-scoC/scoC+) was also constructed to overexpression ScoC on the multiple-copies plasmids (pSU03-scoC).

Firstly, we compared the growth pattern of the wild-type (wt), scoC deletion mutant (BA06-del-scoC), and scoC/scoC+ overexpression strains.
Figure 2a showed that the defect or overexpression of scoC did not affect the cell growth in MM broth in comparison with the wt.
Secondly, since the previous studies in B. subtilis showed that ScoC negatively regulated protease genes of aprE and nprE, and scoC disruption led to significant increase of extracellular protease activity [19, 24], the total extracellular protease activity was determined in of B. pumilus (Fig. 2b).
It was showed that scoC deletion caused 2-fold increase in extracellular proteolytic activity compared to the wt at the time point of 60 h. On the other hand, overexpression of scoC in the del-scoC/scoC+ strain reversed to diminish the increased extracellular protease activity.
Like in B. subtilis, ScoC acted as a negative regulator of extracellular proteases in B. pumilus.

Next, we examined the bacterial motility on the solid and semi-solid plates with agar concentrations of 0.7 and 0.3% [25].
Figure 3 showed that the colony size of BA06-del-scoC was much smaller than that of the wt and del-scoC/scoC+ strains on LB plate with 0.7% agar and MM plate with 0.3% agar, respectively, indicating that both the swarming and swimming motility were compromised after scoC disruption.
The colony expansion in diameter of BA06-del-scoC was statistically different from the wt and overexpression strains with p < 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.
These results indicated that scoC could modulate the cell motility of B. pumilus.

Since flagellum is the movement organ of bacteria, we counted the cell number with flagella or without flagella for the three B. pumilus strains.
It was found that scoC disruption reduced the flagella formation (Fig. 4).
The percentage of cells with flagella were only 23.7% for BA06-del-ScoC.
By contrast, the percentages were 69.8 and 71.1% for the wt and overexpression strains, respectively.
Of interest, previous studies done in B. subtilis showed that many flagellar genes were downregulated in scoC deletion mutant [22].
These results suggested that decrease of cell motility of BA06-del-scoC was at least partially resulted from the reduction of flagella formation.

In addition, formation of endospore and biofilm was also examined.
In contrast to B. subtilis, no significant difference was found among the three B. pumilus stains (Additional file 2: Figure S2), implicating ScoC also plays strain-specific role.



Transcriptome profiling of scoC mutant

To better understand the mechanism underlying the observed phenotypes in B. pumilus, we performed comparative transcriptome profiling using RNA sequencing.
Overall, a total 1674 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with the expression level > 2.5-fold change and p < 0.01 were identified across the three time points at which the BA06-del-scoC and wt cells were compared (Fig. 5a, Additional file 3: Table S1).
The most DEGs were identified at the time point of 12 h with 531 up-regulated and 467 down-regulated.
And DEGs subsequently declined at the later growth phases, suggesting that scoC may play a major role at the transition phase.

By KEGG pathway analysis, the DEGs were categorized into various metabolic pathways, of which the top 10 were displayed in Fig. 5b.
Overall, the expression patterns are very similar between B. subtilis and B. pumilus after scoC disruption.
The largest group with altered transcriptional level in the scoC deletion mutant belongs to the KEGG category of membrane transport [22].
For example, some putative operons involved in the metal ion transport systems (cds3101 - 3105; cds3029 - 3032) were downregulated in BA06-del-scoC strain (Additional file 3: Table S1).
In B. subtilis, some operons like opp and app encoding oligopeptide transport systems have been experimentally confirmed to be directly regulated by scoC [20].
In addition, many affected genes were also enriched in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, translation, transcription, etc.

Nevertheless, there are also significant differences from B. subtilis.
For instance, two protease genes aprE (cds0935) and aprX (cds1594) showed same expression pattern, i.e. upregulation in both strains at 24 and 36 h (Table 1), while the neutral protease gene aprN (cds2061) was decreased in B. pumilus but increased in B. subtilis, respectively.
Furthermore, the other protease gene like epr (cds0246) and vpr (cds3474) did not changed obviously in transcription level in B. pumilus after scoC deletion (Table 1).
Because the proteases like AprE is regulated by both positive and negative regulators in B. subtilis, herein we examined transcriptional level of the homologous regulatory genes in B. pumilus.
It was showed that the negative regulator gene abrB (cds0014) and sinR (cds2171) did not change (Additional file 3: Table S1).
However, the sensor histidine kinase gene degS (cds3226) were upregulated at 12 h, which may promote the phosphorylation level of DegU and in turn enhance the transcription of aprE [26].
This is consistent with increased aprE expression.

Since the scoC mutation displayed defective flagella formation (Fig. 4), we examined the transcriptional profiling of flagella-related genes.
In B. pumilus, these genes are organized as several operons (like flc/che and motAB) or individually scattered in the genome (Additional file 4: Figure S3).
Overall, 63 genes categorized into the KEGG Bacterial Motility (k02035) and Flagellar Assembly (k02040) pathways have a trend to downregulation in BA06-del-scoC strain (Fig. 6a, Additional file 3: Table S1).
Nevertheless, seldom genes were upregulated.
For example, the flgM gene (cds3219, encoding an anti-sigma factor) were upregulated for about 3-fold at 12 h (Additional file 4: Figure S3).
In the fla/che operon, the upregulated genes (fliEFGH, fliJ) may be transcribed from another independent promoter [27].
In addition, the gene swrA encoding a master regulator of motility that activates the cell motility in B. subtilis [28], was also upregulated in scoC deletion mutant of B. pumilus.
Taken together, the transcriptome data suggest that the compromised flagella formation is at least in part due to downregulation of the flagellar structural genes after scoC deletion.

Another group of DEGs is enriched into the KEGG Cell Growth pathway (99978).
Most of these genes related to sporulation were continually upregulated at all three time points in BA06-del-scoC (Fig. 6b), consistent with the finding that scoC disruption promoted sporulation in B. subtilis [17, 24].
However, no overt enhanced sporulation was observed in B. pumilus (Additional file 2: Figure S2A), implicating there might existed additional regulatory pathway in B. pumilus.
Of note, these sporulation-related genes are still not found to interact directly with ScoC.
Therefore, scoC may undergo an indirect pathway to regulate sporulation.
For example, scoC can suppress sporulation by acting as a repressor of the signaling peptide transport systems, opp and app in B. subtilis [20].
Indeed, we found the opp operon (oppABCDF, cds1038 - 1042) was downregulated at 12 h and then upregulated at 24 h in B. pumilus scoC mutant (Additional file 3: Table S1).

Lastly, to confirm the accuracy and reproducibility of the transcriptome data, 13 genes were selected for qPCR validation.
RNA samples from the same cultures of MM at different growth phases were used as template.
The data shown in Table S2 (Additional file 5) indicated that RNA-seq data were almost consistent with the qPCR results.
