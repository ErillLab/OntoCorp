Expression and function of the citrate synthase

In order to better understand the regulation of the expression of gltA, the gene encoding citrate synthase, the abundance of gltA transcripts and the citrate synthase protein was compared under a diversity of growth conditions.
Western blot analysis revealed that the abundance of the citrate synthase protein was lowest when hydrogen was the electron donor and fumarate was the electron acceptor (Figure 1A).
Of the other conditions evaluated, growth with lactate as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor yielded somewhat higher levels of the citrate synthase protein.
Primer extension assays showed that the abundance of gltA transcripts followed a similar pattern (Figure 1B), suggesting that the expression of gltA was primarily regulated at the level of transcription.

The putative -35/-10 promoter elements assigned on the basis of the 5' end of the mRNA sequence in the primer extension assays (Figure 1C) show similarity to those of E. coli RpoD-dependent promoters (34,35) and to those of G. sulfurreducens RpoD/RpoS-like promoters (36).
The promoter region contains the putative extended -10 element (37,38).
Putative transcription termination signals were found downstream of the translation termination codon (Figure 1D).
These results suggest that gltA is monocistronic.

A gltA deletion mutant was isolated with hydrogen as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor with acetate as the carbon source.
Lactate could be substituted for acetate as the carbon source (Table 1).
The mutant was unable to grow with organic acids such as acetate and lactate as the electron donor.
This is expected because gltA encodes the only citrate synthase in G. sulfurreducens (24), and citrate synthase is required for the entry of acetyl-CoA derived from organic acids into the TCA cycle (39).
The mutant also failed to grow with Fe(III) as the electron acceptor even in the presence of hydrogen.
Therefore, the citrate synthase was required for all growth conditions other than with hydrogen as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor, consistent with the low expression of gltA under this growth condition.


Citrate synthase also plays critical roles in growth on organic acids in other microorganisms.
For instance, the absence of the citrate synthase influences the growth rate on propionate, as a citrate synthase-negative strain of E. coli grows significantly more slowly than its parent strain (40).
This citrate synthase mutant can still grow on propionate because E. coli possesses 2-methylcitrate synthase, which is induced during growth on propionate (40).
In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which contains two citrate synthase isozymes, mitochondrial and cytosolic, a deletion of the mitochondrial citrate synthase causes failure in growth on acetate, while the absence of the cytosolic citrate synthase does not affect growth on acetate (41).



Transcriptional regulation of gltA expression

The possibility that the expression of gltA is transcriptionally regulated was further investigated.
A DNA-binding assay performed with the gltA promoter region as a probe detected DNA-binding activity in cell extracts prepared from cultures grown with fumarate as the electron acceptor and acetate or hydrogen as the electron donor (Figure 2A), the growth conditions under which the transcript abundance of gltA was low (Figure 1B).
In contrast, the DNA-binding activity was undetectable or extremely low, under the other growth conditions in which the transcript abundance of gltA was higher.
These results suggested that a transcriptional repressor was involved in the gene regulation.

To determine the binding site for the putative transcriptional repressor, a footprint assay was performed (Figure 2B).
The region from nt +11 to +23 with respect to the transcription initiation site was protected from DNase I in the presence of the ammonium sulfate fraction prepared from cell extracts (see also Figure 1C for the sequence).
This repressor-binding site shows the dyad symmetry.

To examine the effects of this region on the promoter activity, a lacZ fusion assay was carried out (Figure 2C).
When the promoter region up to nt -195 with respect to the transcription initiation site was included, there was high beta-galactosidase activity.
However, no activity was observed when only the region up to nt -2 was included.
Deleting the binding site from the promoter fused to the lacZ gene doubled beta-galactosidase activity over that of the wild-type promoter.
These results further indicate that a transcription factor repressed the expression of gltA by binding the promoter region from nt +11 to +23.



Other genes involved in metabolism

Searching the genome of G. sulfurreducens for the transcriptional repressor binding site sequence of gltA (Figure 1C) revealed that this sequence is also located upstream of the genes encoding aconitase B (acnB), isocitrate dehydrogenase (icd), 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase ferredoxin subunit (oorD), succinyl:acetyl CoA transferase (ato), succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase cytochrome b subunit (frdC), ATP synthase F0 beta' subunit (atpG), nucleoside diphosphate sugar epimerase (nad), NADH dehydrogenase I A subunit (nuoA), soluble Fe(III) reductase beta' subunit (sfrB), sugar phosphate isomerase/epimerase (iolE) and a transcription factor (gntR) in the GntR family (Figure 3A).
These putative binding sites also show the dyad symmetry.
These genes, except for the transcription factor, appear to encode proteins involved in biosynthesis and energy generation, such as the TCA cycle and electron transport systems.
It appears that some of these identified genes (acnB, icd, oorD, frdC, atpG, sfrB, nad and nuoA) are the first gene in an operon and others (ato, fumA, iolE and gntR) are monocistronic.
For example, the frdC gene is co-transcribed with frdA and frdB, the genes encoding the other two subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase/fumarate reductase complex (42).
An analysis of the genome sequence suggested that the icd gene for isocitrate dehydrogenase is in an operon with the mdh gene encoding malate dehydrogenase.
The oorD gene encoding a subunit of 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase appears to be in an operon with the genes oorA, oorB and oorC which encode three other subunits of 2-oxoglutarate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase.
It is likely that the atpG gene is the first gene of the operon encoding other subunits of ATP synthase F0F1.
The nuoA gene appears to be the first gene of the operon encoding other subunits of NADH dehydrogenase I.
It appears likely that the sfrB gene composes an operon with the sfrA gene (43).


All of the genes evaluated (atpG, nuoA, sfrB, frdC, icd and gntR) had lower transcript abundance during growth with hydrogen as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor (Figure 3B), similar to the results with gltA (Figure 1B).
The genes involved in the TCA cycle, frdC and icd, as well as sfrB and gntR had expression patterns similar to gltA under other growth conditions (Figure 3B).
However, atpG and nuoA had transcript abundances during growth on acetate with fumarate as the electron acceptor that were as high as or higher than during growth on lactate.
This contrasts with the higher transcript abundance during growth on lactate for the other genes.

Primer extension assays indicated that the putative repressor binding sites are located at the downstream region of the transcription initiation site, the region overlapping the transcription initiation site, or the region overlapping the -35/-10 promoter elements (data not shown).
These results suggest that the transcriptional repressor inhibits RNA polymerase from binding to the -35/-10 promoter elements or from elongating transcripts.

Searching the genomes of other Geobacter species demonstrated that the transcriptional repressor binding site sequence in the gltA promoter region identified in G. sulfurreducens is conserved within the genus (see Figure 4 for the gltA genes, data not shown for others).
These results suggest that this transcriptional repressor is a regulator for the genes involved in biosynthesis and energy generation in Geobacter species.




Identification of the transcriptional repressor

In order to identify the transcriptional repressor, putative transcription factors encoded in the G. sulfurreducens genome were analyzed.
Among 151 putative transcription factors from G. sulfurreducens, 81 are highly conserved in both G. metallireducens and G. uraniireducens, the other Geobacter species for which other complete genome sequences were available at the time of analysis.
Putative transcription factors that appeared to be involved in regulatory functions, such as a heat-shock responsive repressor, SOS responsive factors and RNA-binding proteins, were excluded from the subsequent assays.
Homologues of enhancer-binding proteins were also excluded because they are typically involved in activation of transcription initiation by RNA polymerase containing the alternative sigma factor RpoN (44 - 46) whereas the genes regulated by the transcriptional repressor are likely transcribed by RNA polymerase containing the major sigma factor RpoD, as described above.
This left 30 putative transcription factors which were selected for the further study.

Of the 30 putative transcription factors evaluated, GSU3370, GSU3298 and GSU3364 bound the gltA promoter region (Figure 5A).
However, GSU3370 showed a different binding pattern from that observed with the G. sulfurreducens cell extracts (Figure 2A), while GSU3298 did not bind the promoters of atp, nuo and gntR (data not shown).
Thus, it is unlikely that GSU3370 or GSU3298 was the repressor.
The ability of GSU3364 to bind the promoter regions of atpG, nuoA and gntR, three other genes predicted to have a repressor-binding site (Figure 3A), was evaluated and GSU3364 bound all the three promoters (Figure 5B).
Footprint assays demonstrated that GSU3364 bound specifically the promoter regions of gltA, atpG, nuoA and gntR (Figure 5C) in the same region expected from the studies outlined above for gltA (Figure 2B) and atpG, nuoA and gntR (Figure 3A).
Therefore, GSU3364, which was termed hydrogen-dependent growth transcriptional repressor (HgtR), is likely the transcriptional repressor.
Although GSU3298 and GSU3370 are not the repressor that binds the sequence identified by the footprint assay (Figure 2B), it is possible that these transcription factors are involved in the regulation of gltA under different growth conditions.
Sequence analysis suggests that putative DNA-binding domains of GSU3298 and GSU3370 are similar to those of the XRE and GntR family, respectively, while their putative regulatory (sensor) domains do not exhibit high similarity to known domains (data not shown).
Their roles in the regulation of gltA remain to be examined.


HgtR is a relatively small protein consisting of 62 amino acid residues (Figure 5D).
As expected, HgtR is conserved in all Geobacter species whose genome sequences are available (Figure 5D).
Although the homologues of HgtR in some of other Geobacter species were annotated as CopG-like DNA-binding protein, the amino acid sequences of HgtR homologues showed no similarity to known proteins.



Expression and function of HgtR

Primer extension assays demonstrated that the expression of hgtR was higher when hydrogen served as the electron donor than in acetate-grown cells (Figure 6A).
This is consistent with the previous results that the genes on which the transcriptional repressor acts were expressed at lower levels during growth on hydrogen.


The highly conserved sequences, GG and GC, of the -24/-12 promoter elements recognized by RpoN (44 - 46) were identified (Figure 6B).
A transcription termination-like signal was found at the downstream of the translation termination codon (Figure 6C), suggesting that hgtR is monocistronic.

When the gene for HgtR was deleted, the mutant was unable to grow with hydrogen as the electron donor and either fumarate or Fe(III) as the electron acceptor (Table 2).
Transcript levels of gltA and nuoA were examined during growth with either acetate or hydrogen as the electron donor and fumarate as the electron acceptor.
Their transcript levels were much higher in the hgtR mutant than the wild-type during growth both in the absence and presence of hydrogen (Figure 7A).
It should be noted that the hgtR mutant grew with acetate as the electron donor as well as the carbon source even in the presence of hydrogen whereas the wild-type cells grew with hydrogen as the electron donor and acetate as the carbon source in the presence of hydrogen.
This suggests that HgtR represses the expression of gltA and nuoA during growth with acetate as the electron donor as well as during growth with hydrogen as the electron donor, which is consistent with the results showing that the activity of HgtR was detected in the culture under these conditions (Figure 2A).
Moreover, this aberrant gene expression caused by the deletion of hgtR made the hgtR mutant cells unable to adapt to growth with hydrogen.


To further evaluate the function of HgtR, a plasmid containing hgtR was introduced into G. sulfurreducens and HgtR was overexpressed.
The overexpression of HgtR resulted in repression of gltA expression (Figure 7B).
This is consistent with the conclusion that HgtR is the repressor for gltA.
