Identification of promoter-like DNA sequence elements between two convergent genes

The starting point for this work was our previous analysis of global CRP binding in enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) [11].
This work predicted a CRP target between the convergent genes aatC (encoding a subunit of a transport system) and tnpA (encoding a transposase).
The genomic context of the CRP site is shown in Fig 1A and the surrounding DNA sequence is shown in Fig 1B.
We searched the locus for promoters that may be under the control of CRP.
A sequence (5'-TAACCT-3') that resembled a promoter -10 hexamer was found close to the CRP site within the aatC coding region (Fig 1B).
A 189 bp ORF, which we named aatS, and a ribosome binding site (RBS) were also identified (Fig 1B).
Note that aatS fully overlaps aatC but is in the opposite orientation.
We considered that the overlap might result from aatC being annotated incorrectly.
However, on close examination, this seems unlikely; there is no alternative stop codon within the aatC open reading frame.
Furthermore, the full aatC sequence is conserved in numerous bacteria.



PaatS is a CRP-dependent promoter in vivo

Our next aim was to determine if the putative promoter upstream of aatS (PaatS) was functional.
Thus, a 134 bp DNA fragment containing the sequence shown in Fig 1B, flanked by EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites, was generated.
The DNA fragment, named aatS1, was cloned upstream of lacZ in plasmid pRW50 to create a PaatS::lacZ fusion.
Next, E. coli M182 and the Deltacrp derivative were transformed with the resulting plasmid.
Transformants were cultured in liquid media and RNA was isolated as a template for primer extension.
A 166 nucleotide primer extension product was observed using RNA from M182.
Conversely, little extension product was observed using RNA from the Deltacrp derivative (compare lanes 5 and 6 in Fig 2A).
Thus, the aatS transcription start site (marked "+1" in Fig 1B) is located 4 bp downstream of the putative aatS promoter -10 hexamer.
Furthermore, PaatS is poorly active in the absence of CRP.
Consistent with our primer extension analysis, PaatS controlled expression of lacZ was also significantly reduced in cells lacking CRP (P = 0.018; Fig 2B).



PaatS is a CRP dependent promoter in vitro

We next confirmed activation of PaatS by CRP using in vitro transcription assays.
The aatS1 DNA fragment was cloned upstream of the lambdaoop transcription terminator in plasmid pSR.
Thus, the transcript generated from PaatS is expected to be 169 nucleotides (nt) in length.
Note that, pSR also encodes RNAI; a 108 nt factor independent transcript derived from the plasmid replication origin.
Thus, we observed two bands on denaturing PAGE gels (Fig 2C).
As expected, synthesis of RNAI did not require CRP.
However, production of the larger 169 nt aatS transcript was stimulated by CRP.



CRP binds a site overlapping the PaatS -35 element

To confirm CRP binding to the predicted target upstream of PaatS we used DNAse I footprinting.
The result of the experiment is shown in Fig 3.
Lane 1 shows the banding pattern resulting from DNAse I cleavage of aatS1 in the absence of CRP.
Alterations to this pattern are evident in lanes 2 - 6 as increasing concentrations of CRP are added.
Thus, CRP induced the appearance of three hypersensitive bands (starred) and protected the flanking DNA regions (underlined).
The footprint aligns precisely with the predicted DNA target for CRP.
The CRP site is 39.5 bases upstream of the PaatS transcription start site (Fig 1B).
However, we note that the aatS mRNA start is 4 bp, rather than the usual 7 bp, downstream of the promoter -10 element.
Hence, CRP is well positioned to interact with RNA polymerase via a standard class II mechanism.



The aatS coding region is preceded by a functional ribosome binding site

The predicted aatS ORF is located 82 bp downstream of the aatS transcription start site, within the coding region of aatC.
We noticed that the 5' end of the aatS mRNA contains a sequence, 5'-UUAAGAAGU-3', that resembles a RBS (5'-UAAGGAGGU-3') [20, 21].
In addition, the predicted aatS RBS is located 6 bp upstream of the aatS start codon, a position suitable for translation initiation [22].
To determine if the RBS was functional, we created a translational aatS1::lacZ fusion and explored the effects of mutating the RBS on lacZ expression.
Thus, we generated a derivative of the aatS1 fragment, called aatS2, where the sequence of the RBS was altered to 5'-UUUUCUUCA-3' (Fig 4).
Both aatS1 and aatS2 were translationally fused to lacZ by cloning into pRW225 [23].
Resulting plasmids were used to transform M182 and the Deltacrp derivative.
LacZ activities were then determined in lysates of transformants grown in liquid culture (Fig 4).
LacZ expression was significantly reduced when the aatS RBS was mutated (P = 0.011).
Residual LacZ expression, driven by the aatS2::lacZ fusion in M182Deltacrp cells, was not significantly different from background LacZ activity (P = 0.096).
Background LacZ activity was obtained using M182Deltacrp transformed with pRW225 having no promoter insert.



AatS contains a conserved domain of unknown function

We cannot exclude the possibility that PaatS drives transcription of a small or antisense RNA.
However, the presence of a functional RBS, appropriately positioned upstream of the aatS open reading frame, is consistent with the transcript being an mRNA.
If this is the case, translation would result in the production of a 62 amino acid AatS peptide.
To better understand AatS we used BLAST to identify 38 microbial proteins with a significantly similar sequence (E-value <10) in the NCBI blastp database.
The search also reveals that AatS shares 67% identity with a conserved domain of unknown function (DUF1602, E-value: 4.07e-7).
Genes encoding DUF1602 are found in diverse species in all kingdoms of life (Table 3).
Strikingly, as in the case of aatS, genes encoding DUF1602 are often genetically associated with, and occasionally overlap, genes encoding transport systems.
We conclude that aatS may encode a small protein that could be an ancillary subunit of the Aat transport system in ETEC.
