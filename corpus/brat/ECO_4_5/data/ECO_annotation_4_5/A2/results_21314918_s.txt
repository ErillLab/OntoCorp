Screening of genes conferring E. coli resistance to ColE7

To search for genes that can confer E. coli resistance to ColE7, plasmids in the genomic library were transformed into the ColE7-sensitive E. coli strain DH5alpha, and the transformants were plated on LB agar plates containing 50 mug/ml of ampicillin and 5.0 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7.
Two colonies were seen after incubation at 37 degrees C overnight.
The plasmids of each colony were isolated after culturing in 3 ml LB medium containing 50 mug/ml of ampicillin then retransformed into DH5alpha.
The new transformants were plated on agar plates containing 0, 1.3, 2.6, 3.9, or 5.2 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7 to confirm their resistance to ColE7.
The insert in the plasmid that conferred DH5alpha resistance to 5.2 ng/ml His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7 was sequenced.
A 1,470-bp DNA region on the chromosome at position 3662617 to 3664086 was analyzed that contains both complete gadX and gadY genes.
The plasmid was thus named pGadXY (Figure 1).

To determine whether gadX or gadY was responsible for ColE7 resistance, pGadX, pGadY, and pGadXY that contain gadX, gadY, and gadXY, respectively, were separately introduced into E. coli strain DH5alpha and then assayed for their ability to confer ColE7 resistance.
1 x 105 cells containing pGadX, pGadY, or pGadXY were plated on LB agar containing 1.3, 2.6, 3.9, or 5.2 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7.
Cells containing the vector pGAD10 were also plated to serve as controls.
The percent survival of cells containing pGAD10, pGadXY, pGadX, and pGadY in the presence of 1.3 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7 were 41.7, 95.5, 71.4, and 73.5%, respectively, and 1.5, 63.9, 3.6, and 9.1%, respectively, in the presence of 2.6 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7.
Only pGadXY conferred ColE7 resistance to 3.9 and 5.2 ng/ml of His6-tagged ColE7/ImE7 with 29.1 and 17.1% survival rates, respectively (Table 1).



Detection of protein whose expression is affected by gadXY

To investigate the mechanism by which gadXY affects ColE7 resistance, the expression levels of BtuB, TolQ, TolR, TolA, TolB, Pal, and OmpF that are involved in ColE7 import were determined by Western blotting, and BtuB was the only protein found to be affected.
Its expression level was reduced by 93% in the presence of gadXY (Figure 2) as determined by densitometry.



Effect of gadXY on btuB promoter

To determine whether gadXY affects the transcription of btuB, the beta-galactosidase reporter assay was performed.
The 461-, 673-, 913-, and 1285-bp DNA fragments (Figure 3) containing the promoter of btuB were fused with the lacZ coding sequence to generate pCB461lacZ, pCB673lacZ, pCB913lacZ, and pCB1285lacZ, respectively.
Each of these single copy plasmid together with pGAD10 or pGadXY was transformed into E. coli strain DH5alpha.
The transformed cells were grown in LB medium with 50 mug/ml of chloramphenicol and ampicilin to OD600~0.8 then assayed for beta-galactosidase activity as described by Miller [39].
The beta-galactosidase activity of cells containing pGadXY and a pCB derivative with the btuB promoter-lacZ fusion was divided by that of cells containing the control plasmid pGAD10 and the same pCB derivative to determine the percent decrease in btuB promoter activity in the presence of gadXY.
The btuB promoter in the 461-, 673-, 913-, and 1285-bp DNA fragment was found to be decreased by 45.7, 47.1, 54.5, and 56.7%, respectively in the presence of gadXY, and was about 6 fold more active in the 1285-bp fragment than in other fragments (Table 2).

To investigate the effect of gadX or gadY alone on the promoter activity of btuB, the same experiment was performed using DH5alpha cells containing pCB1285lacZ and pGAD10, pGadXY, pGadX, or pGadY.
The beta-galactosidase activity of cells containing pCB1285lacZ and pGadXY, pGadX, or pGadY was compared to those containing pGAD10 and pCB1285lacZ.
The results indicated that btuB promoter activity was decreased 20.5% by gadX and 20.3% by gadY, but was decreased 54.4% by gadXY (Table 3).



Binding of GadX to btuB promoter

GadX has been shown to be a DNA binding protein and can bind to the gadA or the gadB promoter.
To determine whether GadX also binds to the btuB promoter, the DNA mobility shift assay was performed.
Only GadX was assayed because gadY does not encode any proteins.
The 461-bp DNA fragment containing the btuB promoter was labeled with 32P and incubated with 2, 4, or 6 pmoles of purified GadX protein (MalE-GadX) that was fused to the maltose binding protein.
The DNA fragment containing the promoter of gadA or gadB was used as the positive control for GadX binding, and the DNA fragment containing the pal promoter was used as the negative control.
As shown in Figure 4, DNA band shift was observed on gadA and gadB promoter fragments but not on the negative control.
Band shift was also observed on the btuB promoter fragment in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that GadX binds to the btuB promoter.



Identification of binding sequence of GadX on btuB promoter

DNase I footprinting was then performed to determine the binding sequence of GadX on the btuB promoter.
The 461-bp DNA fragment containing the btuB promoter was labeled with 32P and incubated with 0, 2, 4, or 8 pmoles of purified MalE-GadX protein and then digested with DNase I.
Results shown in Figure 5 revealed three MalE-GadX protein binding sites that included nucleotide positions +56 - +81 (I), +96 - +105 (II) and +123 - +137 (III) on the 5' untranslated region of btuB.



Decreased btuB expression under acidic conditions

It is known that gadX and gadY are more highly expressed under acidic environments in stationary phase [15-19,28].
To determine whether the expression of btuB is also repressed in an acidic condition, wild type BW25113 cells were cultured in LB medium pH 7.4 or buffered with 100 mM MES pH5.5.
Stationary phase cells grown in different culture media were collected and then assayed for the transcriptional level of btuB by quantitative real-time PCR.
The cDNA amplification comparison results showed the transcription of gadX with 1.4-fold increase but the level of btuB was reduced to 57% (Table 4).
