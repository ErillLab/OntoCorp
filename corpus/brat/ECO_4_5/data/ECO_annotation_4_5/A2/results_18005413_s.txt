The extended fructose-PTS gene cluster of C. glutamicum contains four transcriptional units

In the genome of C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 [17], the locations of the five PTS genes ptsI, ptsH,ptsF, ptsG, and ptsS were identified.
On this account, the PTS genes can be grouped into the fructose-PTS gene cluster (ptsI, cg2118, fruK, ptsF, and ptsH) and the distantly located glucose- and sucrose-PTS genes ptsG and ptsS, respectively, as well as the hitherto uncharacterized genes cg3365 and cg3366 (Table 1).
The genes ptsI, cg2118, fruK, ptsF, and ptsH of the fructose-PTS cluster together with the region encoding sugR and cg2116 form the extended fructose-PTS gene cluster (Table 1).

In order to analyse the transcriptional organization of the extended fructose-PTS gene cluster, mRNA transcripts overlapping adjacent coding regions were investigated by real-time RT-PCR.
In these experiments, mRNAs spanning the intergenic regions between sugR and cg2116, cg2118 and fruK, fruK and ptsF, and between ptsF and ptsH, respectively, were detected in the C. glutamicum strain RES167 grown on glucose (data not shown).
However, a non-coding region of 188 bp between the coding regions of ptsF and ptsH was observed indicating a possible promoter upstream of ptsH.
Considering these observations and the localization of ptsI on the opposite strand, it is most likely, that the genes sugR-cg2116 and cg2118-fruK-ptsF form two operons, whereas ptsI is monocistronic.
Although a read-through transcription from ptsF to ptsH was detected, the ptsH gene is probably also transcribed monocistronically.
The operon predictions by the computer program VIMSS [25] and the predicted positions of transcriptional terminators 3' of cg2116, ptsI and ptsH determined by the computer program TransTerm [26], depicted as stem-loop structures in Fig. 1A, support this view.

Consistent with these interpretations, four transcriptional start sites were localized upstream from the genes sugR, ptsI, cg2118, and ptsH, using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method (Fig. 1).
The deduced promoter sequences showed similarities to the sequences of the -10 (Tac/taaT) and -35 (TTTGCC/TTGGCA/TTGCCA) regions of the C. glutamicum consensus promoter [27].
The promoter of the cg2118-fruK-ptsF operon showed the highest similarity to the consensus promoter, whereas the promoters of sugR-cg2116, ptsI, and ptsH were less conserved, especially in the -35 region, (Fig. 1B).
Furthermore, it was found that the divergent promoters PptsI and Pcg2118produce mRNAs overlapping by a complementary sequence of 14 nucleotides.



Transcription of the fructose-PTS gene cluster is enhanced in C. glutamicum cultures grown on glucose or fructose when compared to cultures grown on acetate

In order to investigate a carbon source-dependent expression of the genes belonging to the extended fructose-PTS gene cluster, the transcription levels were investigated by RT-PCR experiments.
For this purpose, total mRNA was isolated from C. glutamicum RES167, grown in minimal media containing acetate, glucose or fructose as a sole carbon source.
Glucose and fructose were employed as PTS sugars requiring the expression of the PTS gene cluster for their uptake, whereas acetate represents a non-PTS carbon source.
The relative mRNA amounts of the genes belonging to the extended fructose-PTS cluster (sugR to ptsH) were determined using real-time RT-PCR.
The values from the glucose- and fructose-grown cultures were compared to those obtained from cultures grown on acetate (Fig. 2).
The mRNA levels of sugR and cg2116 showed only minor changes during growth on glucose and fructose in comparison to acetate.
In contrast to this, all genes of the fructose-PTS gene cluster from cg2117 (ptsI) to cg2120 (ptsH) showed significantly higher mRNA levels during growth on glucose and fructose.
The levels of the genes ptsI and ptsH did not differ between cells grown on glucose and fructose.
This is in accordance with the need for expression in the presence of both sugars.
In contrast to this, mRNA isolated from fructose grown cultures showed significantly higher transcription of cg2118, fruK, and ptsF.
The different expression patterns of cg2118, fruK, and ptsF in cultures grown on glucose or fructose as sole carbon sources correlated with the requirement of the cell for a higher expression of the fructose-specific enzymeII (ptsF) and the 1-phosphofructokinase encoded by fruK with fructose as the sole carbon source.
These results are a clear indication for a carbon source-dependent transcriptional regulation of the genes of the PTS cluster.



The sugR gene is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the fructose-PTS cluster containing ptsI, cg2118, fruK, ptsF, and ptsH of C. glutamicum

Due to the classification of sugR and cg2118 as DeoR-type regulators, they are both interesting candidate genes for investigating their involvement in the carbon source-dependent transcriptional regulation of the fructose-PTS cluster genes.
Single deletion mutants of sugR and cg2118 were constructed by gene replacement in C. glutamicum RES167 in order to elucidate the possible roles in this regulation (data not shown).
These deletions removed 242 of 780 nucleotides from the sugR coding region and 674 of 795 nucleotides from the cg2118 coding region, rendering the respective gene non-functional and resulting in strains LG01 (RES167 DeltasugR) and LG02 (RES167 Deltacg2118), respectively.

The possible involvement of sugR or cg2118 in transcriptional regulation of ptsI, the cg2118-fruK-ptsF operon, and ptsH was determined by real-time RT-PCR.
For these experiments, total mRNAs isolated from RES167 and the mutant strains LG01 and LG02 were used.
The cells were grown in shaking flasks in liquid minimal media with 2% acetate as sole carbon source.
Acetate as the sole carbon source was chosen, because an increased transcription of the fructose-PTS cluster genes could be observed when RES167 was grown on glucose and fructose instead on acetate.
Therefore, growth on acetate may cause the transcriptional repression of the fructose-PTS cluster genes.
To find out whether the sugR or the cg2118 gene product is involved in the transcriptional regulation of the fructose-PTS cluster genes, the expression in the two deletion mutants LG01 and LG02 was compared to the expression in the RES167 strain when all strains were grown on acetate.
The analysis revealed a strongly increased transcription of the fructose-PTS cluster genes ptsI, cg2118, fruK, ptsF, and ptsH in the sugR mutant LG01 (Fig. 3).
In contrast to this, the transcription of the fructose-PTS cluster genes in the cg2118 mutant LG02 was only weakly influenced.
It is therefore concluded, that the sugR gene product downregulates transcription of the fructose-PTS gene cluster during growth on acetate, whereas cg2118 and its gene product does not seem to be involved in the transcription of the fructose-PTS cluster genes under the applied experimental conditions.



The sugR gene of C. glutamicum is involved in the repression of PTS gene transcription

Comparative microarray hybridization experiments with total mRNA isolated from the cg2115 deletion mutant LG01 and the parental strain RES167 both grown on acetate were conducted in order to explore the complete SugR regulon.
In the microarray experiments using the C. glutamicum whole-genome DNA microarray described previously [28], two biological replicates were hybridized, simultaneously applying label-swapping.
The results of the microarray experiments comparing the sugR mutant and the RES167 strain revealed 23 genes with increased and five genes with decreased transcript levels in the sugR mutant.
All genes of the fructose-PTS gene cluster were found in the group of genes with induced transcript levels (Fig. 4 and Table 2).
Interestingly, the genes ptsG and ptsS, which encode the enzyme II proteins for the uptake of glucose and sucrose, respectively, were also found to have an elevated expression level.
To confirm the microarray results, subsequent real-time RT-PCR measurements were conducted, which validated the enhanced transcription of ptsG and ptsS in the sugR mutant with ratios of 16.8 and 101.8 compared to RES167, respectively.
Beside the PTS genes, the transcriptional levels of ldh and adhA encoding lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase, respectively, were found to be significantly increased.
Significant increases in transcript levels were also observed for cg2025 and cg2026, encoding hypothetical proteins.
Besides ldh and adhA, no further genes with known function in carbon metabolism were found to be significantly induced.

Since Engels and Wendisch [22] also compared global transcript levels by microarray hybridizations in a sugR mutant and its parent strain, the resulting stimulon can be compared to the one obtained in this work.
In the intersection of the genes showing elevated transcript levels in both experiments, only the PTS genes mentioned above are apparent.
The remaining genes corresponding to each stimulon are different between both studies and might be a result of the different growth conditions used (LB versus minimal media with acetate) or might be results of an indirect effect of the derepression of PTS gene transcription.



The SugR protein of C. glutamicum binds to sequences located upstream of the coding regions of ptsI, cg2118, ptsH, ptsG, and ptsS

To verify the direct involvement of the SugR protein in the regulation of the PTS gene cluster electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed.
For these experiments the SugR protein was purified after overexpression in E. coli as an N-terminal translational fusion with a self-cleavable intein tag using the pTYB1 vector [29].
The advantage of this system is that the native protein can be obtained without an additional attached tag sequence.
The quality of the purified protein was controlled by 1-dimensional SDS-PAGE and its size was estimated to be ~28 kDa.
This observation is in accordance with the annotation of the sugR coding region, which is predicted to encode a 27.6 kDa protein with an N-terminal DeoR-domain comprising a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif.
The identity of SugR was subsequently confirmed by peptide mass fingerprinting using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (data not shown).

As binding partners for SugR in the EMSA experiments, overlapping and fluorescently-labeled PCR fragments from the intergenic regions between ptsI and cg2118, as well as the regions upstream from the coding regions of sugR, ptsH, ptsG, ptsS, adhA, cg2025, and cg2026 were generated.
As negative controls, internal DNA fragments of the cg2118- and ptsH-coding region were also produced by PCR and incubated with the purified protein to test for non-specific binding of the protein (data not shown).

For the gel retardation experiments 15 pmol of the SugR protein and 0.05 pmol of the fluorescently-labeled PCR fragments were used.
It was shown that SugR caused band-shifts in experiments with DNA fragments I1, I2, and I4 located in the ptsI-cg2118 intergenic region (Fig. 5).
Furthermore, binding of the purified SugR protein was observed to the DNA fragment H1 which is located upstream of the ptsH coding region, to the fragments G1 and G2 located upstream of the ptsG coding region and to the fragments S1 to S3 derived upstream of the coding region of ptsS.

The promoter region of sugR was also tested for SugR binding, but no shifts of the labeled PCR fragments were detected (Fig. 5).
Furthermore, labeled PCR fragments upstream of the cg2025, cg2026, and adhA coding regions were tested in EMSA experiments, but no binding of SugR was observed (data not shown).



The C. glutamicum SugR repressor binds to two 21 bp DNA regions interfering with ptsI and cg2118-fruK-ptsF transcription

As described above, SugR binding was detected to the DNA fragments I2 and I4 located in the intergenic region between ptsI and cg2118.
In contrast, no binding to the DNA fragment I3 was observed.
These observations helped to identify two genetic regions A and B which are proposed to carry the specific binding sites for SugR (Fig. 6A).
Region A is a 59 bp long sub-region of the DNA fragment I2 and region B is a 87 bp long sub-region of I4.
DNA sequence comparison of regionA to regionB revealed highly similar sequences of 21 nucleotides in length.
To confirm these motifs as putative SugR binding sequences, double-stranded(ds)-oligonucleotides perfectly matching the 21 nucleotides with four flanking basepairs, representing the original genomic sequence on both sides, were used in competitive EMSA experiments and denoted as oligoA and oligoB, respectively (Fig. 6B).
Interestingly, both oligonucleotides were able to displace the labeled DNA fragment I2.
To further verify the binding sequence of SugR, ds-oligonucleotides with transversions of the four flanking basepairs of oligoA and oligoB, resulted in oligoAt and oligoBt, respectively, which were used in additional EMSA experiments (Fig. 6B).
OligoAt and oligoBt, however, showed no differences in the competitory EMSA experiments compared to oligoA and oligoB, defining both 21 bp long binding motifs as sufficient for SugR binding.
According to the localization of the two SugR binding motifs in regionA and regionB of the DNA fragments I2 and I4, respectively (Fig. 6A), these two motifs were named motifA and motifB.

Subsequently, the positions of the two 21 bp SugR binding sequences motifA and motifB were mapped in the intergenic region between the coding regions of ptsI and cg2118 (Fig. 7).
The two experimentally proven binding motifs in the intergenic region between ptsI and cg2118 are located within Pcg2118and downstream of PptsI (motifA), or downstream the Pcg2118(motifB), respectively.
Due to the divergent orientation of the coding regions ptsI and cg2118 and the overlapping transcripts from the promoters Pcg2118and PptsI, binding of SugR to motifA will interfere with transcription from both promoters, whereas the binding of SugR to motifB will only interfere with the transcription from Pcg2118.

To find additional binding sites of SugR, sequence alignments of motifA and motifB to the upstream coding regions of ptsH, ptsG and ptsS were conducted.
In these alignments, only DNA regions which showed a band-shift in the EMSA experiments were used.

By this, two putative binding motifs were found upstream of the coding regions of ptsH and ptsG and ptsS namely ptsH1, ptsH2 and ptsG1, ptsG2 and ptsS1, ptsS2 respectively (Fig. 8).
Concluding, these experiments led to the identification of eight binding motifs.
Two validated SugR binding sequences motifA and motifB located in the intergenic region of ptsI and cg2118, as well as six putative binding motifs located upstream of the coding regions of ptsH, ptsG, and ptsS.
Sequence alignments of all eight motifs revealed that the six nucleotides ACAAAC in the 5'- and the four nucleotides AACA in the 3'-region were well conserved (Fig. 8).
Additionally, a predominant occurence was observed for cytosine and adenine nucleotides at positions 9 to 17 of the consensus motif.
The characteristics of the putative consensus motif were determined as an A+C-rich and non-palindromic sequence (Fig. 8).



The effectors fructose-1-phosphate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, and glucose-6-phosphate influence the binding activity of the SugR repressor

In order to determine the effector substances influencing the activity of SugR, additional EMSA experiments were carried out.
In these experiments, the SugR-I2 complex was incubated with fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P) which exclusively occurs when fructose is taken up by the fructose-specific PTS.
Additionally, glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) occurring during the transport of glucose by the glucose-specific PTS component PtsG, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-P) and fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P), originating from the consumption of different sugars, as intermediates of glycolysis were used.
Furthermore, the non-phosphorylated substrates of PtsF and PtsG, fructose and glucose, respectively, as well as acetate were used.

A loss of SugR binding to the DNA fragment I2 was observed to different extents using increasing concentrations of F-1-P, F-1,6-P, and G-6-P (Fig. 9).
Using F-1-P as effector substance a clear effect at concentrations equal to and exceeding 10 muM could be observed.
In the case of F-1,6-P, significantly higher concentrations of the effector substance ( GTEQ 5 mM) for resolving the SugR-I2 complex had to be applied.
Additionally, G-6-P showed significant influence on the SugR-I2 complex only at concentrations above 10 mM.
The binding of SugR to the DNA fragment I2 was not influenced by F-6-P concentrations up to 60 mM (Fig. 9).
Additionally, no influence was observed on SugR binding using the non-phosphorylated sugars glucose and fructose as well as acetate at concentrations up to 60 mM (data not shown).
