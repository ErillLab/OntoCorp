The Geobacter sulfurreducens rpoN gene cluster

An rpoN ortholog (GSU1887), which encodes the RpoN sigma factor, is present in the G. sulfurreducens genome.
Phylogenetic analysis showed that G. sulfurreducens RpoN is very similar to other experimentally characterized RpoN sigma factors, such as the Escherichia coli RpoN [19].
The G. sulfurreducens RpoN polypeptide displays characteristic structures of the members of the RpoN family, including an N-terminal glutamine-rich region (the first 50 amino acids), a C-terminal X-link, a helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif, and an RpoN box (ARRTVTKYRE) [25].

Analysis of the chromosomal region surrounding the G. sulfurreducens rpoN gene revealed that its downstream genes encode a homolog of a ribosomal subunit interface protein (GSU1886) whose N-terminal domain is homologous to the RpoN modulation protein found in Klebsiella pneumoniae [26] and a homolog of Hpr (Ser) kinase/phosphorylase (GSU1885).
The upstream genes encode an ATP binding protein (GSU1888) and two conserved proteins (GSU1889 and GSU1890) with unknown function (Figure 1a).

In order to understand the physiological role of RpoN and of genes it controls in G. sulfurreducens, construction of a deletion mutant of the rpoN gene was attempted.
However, an rpoN mutant could not be isolated under different growth conditions using media with different electron acceptors (fumarate or Fe(III) citrate) and amendments (glutamine or glutamate) (Table 1).
Different mutagenesis strategies were attempted, including deletion of the whole coding region of the rpoN gene, only the 5'-end of the rpoN coding region, or only the 3'-end of the rpoN coding region (Figure 1b).
No viable mutants were derived from above attempts.
We also constructed an rpoN diploid strain (DLCN43) in which an extra copy of the rpoN gene was integrated into the chromosome and controlled by the promoter from a chloramphenicol resistance cassette (Figure 1c).
Attempts of deleting and replacing the original rpoN gene from DLCN43 also failed.
Furthermore, an extra copy of the rpoN gene under the control of a constitutively active lac promoter, or under the control of an IPTG (isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactoside)-inducible taclac promoter was introduced to the wild type strain in trans (Figure 1d).
Attempts of deleting the chromosomal rpoN gene yielded viable isolates.
However, further analysis of these isolates indicated that none of them had deletion of the chromosomal rpoN gene.
In contrast, insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette at the intergenic regions immediately upstream or downstream of the rpoN gene yielded viable mutants, suggesting that the inability to isolate an rpoN-deletion mutant was not due to the polar effects of the kanamycin resistance cassette.
The conditions and mutagenesis methods used in this work for our attempts to isolate a null rpoN mutant are summarized in Table 1, and mutation scheme is illustrated in Figure 1.



RpoN expression patterns and over-expression of RpoN

In order to understand RpoN expression under different growth conditions, Western blot analysis was performed using anti-sera against RpoN with cell extracts prepared from cultures grown with a variety of electron donors/acceptors.
RpoN levels were similar in cultures grown in the presence of ammonium or when nitrogen fixation was required in ammonia-free medium, and RpoN was constitutively expressed under all other conditions tested (Figure 2a).

Because an rpoN deletion mutant could not be obtained, a strain in which the rpoN gene was over-expressed under the control of the IPTG-inducible taclac promoter was generated to gain insights into the function of RpoN.
The strain capable of over-expressing RpoN (DL1/pCDrpoN) and the control strain harboring the empty vector pCD341 (DL1/pCD341) were designated RpoN+ and WTV, respectively, for simplification.
The over-expression of the RpoN protein in RpoN+ after induction was confirmed using Western blot analysis (Figure 2b).
The abundance of the RpoN protein in the RpoN+ strain was 5.4 times more than that of the wild type with IPTG induction, but it stayed at a similar level as that of the wild type in the absence of IPTG.
The WTV strain, with or without the addition of IPTG, had levels of RpoN similar to those in the wild type strain.

When induced with IPTG, the RpoN+ strain grew slower and had a longer lag phase than the WTV strain with either fumarate or Fe(III) citrate as the electron acceptor and acetate as the electron donor (Figure 3a, c &3d).
The effect of over-expressing RpoN on growth was more pronounced when cells were grown in media lacking ammonia (Figure 3b).
The doubling times for the WTV and the RpoN+ strains were 7.5 and 9.7 hours, respectively, in the presence of IPTG in the NBAF medium (Figure 3a).
Under nitrogen fixation conditions, the doubling times for the WTV and the RpoN+ strains were 12.5 and 51.3 hours, respectively, in the presence of IPTG in the ammonium-free NBAF medium (Figure 3b).
For FWAFC media, the doubling times were 9.6 and 14.9 hours with IPTG for WTV and RpoN+, respectively (Figure 3d).
The RpoN+ strain grew similarly with the WTV strain in the absence of IPTG in all media.
These results suggest that over-expression of RpoN inhibited growth under various conditions.



The RpoN regulon identified by genome-scale transcriptome analysis and prediction of RpoN-dependent promoters

To elucidate the function of RpoN in Geobacter species, the transcriptome of the RpoN+ and the WTV strains was compared in order to identify those genes whose transcription is regulated by RpoN.
Due to different growth rates between the two strains in the NBAF medium (Figure 3), total RNA was isolated independently from three sets of WTV and RpoN+ cultures during the exponential growth phase, about OD600 = 0.3 - 0.35 and 0.2 - 0.25 for the WTV and RpoN+ strains, respectively.

With a 1.5 fold-change cutoff and a relatively strong cutoff for false discovery rate (FDR) of p < 0.0005, the RpoN+ strain was found to have 138 genes with increased transcript levels and 59 genes with decreased transcript levels when compared to the WTV strain.
The fold change of the transcription level of the rpoN gene itself was 6.61 higher in the RpoN+ strain than in the WTV strain, which is in agreement with protein over-expression results obtained by the Western blot analysis.
A complete list of the differentially expressed genes and their expression ratio is provided as additional files (see Additional files 1 &2).
The 196 genes with significant changes in expression level in the RpoN+ strain were assigned to 16 functional groups.
Most of them encoded hypothetical proteins or proteins with unknown function (63 genes).
The top three categories of genes with annotated functions consisted of genes associated with protein synthesis (33), energy metabolism (21 genes), and transport and binding (12).

In addition to observing the RpoN regulon by using gene expression microarrays, we employed computational analysis using the PromScan software [27] to identify RpoN recognition sequence elements within the G. sulfurreducens genome.
The search identified 798 putative RpoN recognition sequence elements with scores GTEQ 80 (data not shown).
Among these sequence elements, 467 elements were located upstream of protein-coding genes, in the same strand orientation as their potential target genes.
Of these possible promoter elements that could potentially regulate transcription of protein-coding genes, 110 were located in noncoding regions.
We considered these 110 sequence elements to be the most likely RpoN-regulated promoters.
Their sequences and genome locations are provided in Additional file 3, while their predicted target genes and operons are provided in Additional file 4.
The consensus sequence of these 110 predicted G. sulfurreducens RpoN-regulated promoter elements listed in Additional file 3 was TTGGCACGGTTTTTGCT, where the -24 GG and the -12 GC dinucleotides are in bold.
The highest scoring RpoN-regulated promoter was located upstream of the flagella biosynthesis operon containing the fliA gene encoding the RNA polymerase sigma factor FliA (sigma28) (see Additional file 4).

Genome locations of the 110 RpoN-dependent sequence elements identified using the PromScan analysis were cross-examined with the list of genes identified by the transcriptome analysis with a fold change cutoff of 1.25.
The results of this comparison are listed in Additional file 5, and selected operons encoding genes related to nitrogen assimilation, appendages and solute transport are listed in Table 2.
These combined data showed that RpoN regulatory elements can be found in not only up-regulated genes, but also down-regulated genes.
The increased transcript levels observed for some genes could result from increased RpoN availability for transcription initiation that is the limiting factor at a normal rpoN transcript level.
The decreased transcript levels for some genes could be due to the fact that RpoN alone can bind to the -24/-12 elements without the core RNAP, and therefore the promoter regions may not be accessible by other sigma factors, or less core RNAP may be available in the excess of RpoN [1,28].

Both microarray transcriptome analysis and computational prediction of RpoN promoter elements concluded that the dcuB gene, which encodes the fumarate/succinate exchanger (C4-dicarboxylate transporter), is RpoN-dependent.
Both analyses also indicated that genes encoding components for nitrogen assimilation, such as glutamine synthetase (GS) (GSU1835), are RpoN-dependent (Table 2).
Furthermore, our computational analysis identified an RpoN promoter upstream of the glutamate synthetase (GSU1239, GOGAT) operon.
The microarray analysis indicated that the gene encoding glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) (GSU1305) is RpoN-dependent.

In silico modeling analysis was utilized to understand the role of GDH, GS and GOGAT enzymes in G. sulfurreducens metabolism.
The growth of G. sulfurreducens was simulated under different growth conditions, varying electron donors, electron acceptors, and nitrogen sources.
In silico modeling analysis suggested that missing both GS and GOGAT enzymes or GDH, GS and GOGAT is lethal under all growth conditions.

Other genes identified by both the transcriptome analysis and the computational promoter prediction include those encoding flagella biosynthesis, formate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Table 2 and Additional file 5).

An RpoN-dependent regulatory element, located upstream of the pilA gene encoding pilin, the building block for nanowires [29], was identified by the PromScan software in this study and by 5'-RACE analysis in an earlier study [30].
Therefore, the effect of RpoN-overexpression was tested on the pili formation via a cell agglutination assay at 25 degrees C [31].
In the presence of IPTG, the RpoN+ strain displayed less agglutination at 25 degrees C than WTV and WT (Figure 3e), which strongly suggests that RpoN is involved in pili biogenesis.

Genes that were differentially expressed in the RpoN+ strain but for which no RpoN-dependent regulatory elements could be found include those encoding components of stress response/molecular chaperones, central metabolism, extracellular electron transfer, and genes encoding regulatory proteins (see Additional files 1 &2), suggesting their possible indirect regulation by RpoN or a possibility that their RpoN promoters may be too divergent from promoters in other bacteria to be detected using computational approaches.
Alternatively, the physiological states caused by the overexpression of RpoN in the RpoN+ strain, which were different from those in the WTV strain, such as slower growth, might affect gene regulation.



Evaluation of predicted RpoN-dependent promoters via primer extension analysis

In order to further validate the results of the microarray transcriptome analysis and of the computational promoter prediction and to examine promoters regulating differentially expressed genes, primer extension assays were carried out on 12 selected operons or singleton genes, including seven genes with increased expression and five genes with decreased expression in the microarray analysis (Table 3).
These selections included 1) genes involved in cellular functions that were reported in other bacteria to be RpoN-dependent, such as flagella biosynthesis and nitrogen assimilation; or 2) genes involved in physiological functions that were not previously reported to be RpoN-dependent in other bacteria, but were predicted to have conserved RpoN-dependent -24/-12 promoter elements in their regulatory regions, or 3) genes encoding enzymes that are essential for cell growth.
The trend of changes in transcript levels observed in the primer extension assays was similar to that reported in the microarray analysis (Figure 4, Table 3 and Additional file 6), with an exception of GSU1836 (glnB), which encodes a PII nitrogen regulatory protein.

Eight genes out of the 12 selected genes had promoter elements identified by the primer extension assays to match those identified by the computational predictions, and six of these eight genes were found to be regulated by promoter sequences highly similar to other bacterial RpoN promoter elements (Table 3).
These six RpoN-regulated genes were GSU0420 (fliL), GSU1836 (glnB), GSU2806 (nifEN), GSU3046 (flgJ), GSU2751 (dcuB) and GSU0777 (fdnG) (Figure 4 &5 and Table 3).
Alignment of these six G. sulfurreducens RpoN promoter elements and of the promoter element upstream of the pilA gene identified in the previous study [30] was shown (Figure 5).

While conserved RpoN-regulated promoters were predicted for other four genes/operons (GSU0939, GSU2005, GSU2490 and GSU3206) by the computational tools (see Additional file 4), no -24/-12 RpoN-dependent promoter elements could be identified by primer extension assays for these genes/operons (see Additional file 6).
It is possible that the predicted RpoN-regulated promoter elements for these four genes/operons are activated only under certain conditions, such as nitrogen-fixing conditions, which were different from the conditions for the primer extension assays.

In conclusion, the primer extension analyses showed that RpoN-regulated promoters are located upstream of genes for a fumarate/succinate exchanger (GSU2751, dcuB), glutamine synthetase (GSU1836-1835 operon, glnB-glnA), flagella biosynthesis proteins (GSU0420 - 0426, and GSU3040 - 3046), nitrogen assimilation enzymes (GSU2802 - 2806), and a formate dehydrogenase (GSU0777 - 0781).
In addition, an RpoN-regulated promoter was also identified for the pilA gene (GSU1496) by 5'-RACE analysis [30].
