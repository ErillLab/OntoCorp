OxyS is a conserved mycobacterial LysR-type regulator and is involved in regulation of katG

Using a previously developed bacterial one-hybrid system, we have successfully isolated a number of novel transcription factors involved in the regulation of virulence genes in M. tuberculosis[19].
Interestingly, among the many newly identified transcription factors, we found OxyS was involved in the regulation of katG.
The M. tuberculosis OxyS protein shares strong sequence identity with the LysR-type transcriptional regulator family (conserved domains database (CDD), NCBI).
As shown in Fig. 1A and 1B, the N-terminal part of OxyS contains the helix-turn-helix motif and the C-terminal region contains a LysR substrate-binding domain which is structurally homologous to type-2 periplasmic binding proteins.
Furthermore, the N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif of OxyS was found to be highly conserved among several different mycobacterial species (Fig. S1, Table 1).

A previous study implied that OxyS is involved in regulation of KatG activity in M. tuberculosis[17].
Since the regions upstream of the katG gene in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis are highly conserved [8] (Fig. S2) we decided to explore that further by over-expressing M. tuberculosis OxyS in M. smegmatis to determine the physiological role of OxyS.
As shown in Fig. 1C, OxyS reached a high level of expression in the recombinant strain as revealed by Western blotting assays using anti-OxyS serum.
Notably, qRT-PCR (Quantitative real-time PCR) analysis indicated that the level of katG expression in the recombinant M. smegmatis strain was only 36% of that of the control strain (Fig. 1D).
In contrast, the expression level of furA showed no significant change when compared with M. smegmatis strains harboring empty vectors.
These results indicate that the expression of katG is negatively regulated by OxyS, while the furA expression is not regulated by OxyS.



OxyS directly targets the promoter region of katG in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis

To examine whether a direct interaction occurs between OxyS and the regulatory sequence of the M. tuberculosis katG gene, a bacterial one-hybrid assay was conducted by cloning the katG promoter region upstream of HIS3-aadA reporter genes of the bacterial one-hybrid reporter vector pBXcmT (Fig. 2A) [19].
As shown in Fig. 2B, co-transformant strains with the katG promoter and OxyS grew well on selective plates.
In contrast, the strains containing either OxyS alone or the katG promoter alone did not grow on selective plates.
In addition, co-transformant strains containing the promoter of Rv3911 (Rv3911p), an unrelated promoter, and OxyS did not grow either (Fig. 2B).
These results indicate that OxyS can specifically interact with the promoter of the katG gene.

Using anti-OxyS antibodies and ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) assays, we characterized the association of OxyS with the katG promoter in vivo in M. tuberculosis.
Fig. 2C (top panel) shows that the signal for katG promoter was enriched in the anti-OxyS immunoprecipitate compared with that in the control sample without any antibody.
In contrast, no obvious signal was observed for the promoter of Rv3911 (Rv3911p) in both the anti-OxyS and the control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2C, bottom panel).
We successfully purified soluble His-tagged OxyS from an E. coli expression system by inducing the expression of MtbOxyS protein under low temperature conditions (Fig. S3).
Binding of the purified OxyS protein with the katG promoter was then confirmed by further EMSA (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) experiments.
As shown in Fig. 2D, when increasing amounts of OxyS (100 - 600 nM) were added into the reactions, shifted bands corresponding to the OxyS/katG promoter complex were observed and a corresponding increase in the percentage of protein/DNA complexes was seen.
Using competitive EMSA assays (Fig. S4C), we comfirmed that this interaction was specific.
Notably, the interaction of OxyS with the promoter of MsmkatG was also confirmed in the recombinant OxyS-overexpressing M. smegmatis strain by both ChIP and EMSA assays (Fig. S5).

Taken together, these results indicate that OxyS can specifically interact with the promoter of the katG gene in vivo and in vitro, and this direct interaction is conserved in both M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis.



Characterization of the binding sites and sequence motifs for OxyS in the promoter region of katG

To identify the binding sites for OxyS in the promoter region of katG (katGp), we first obtained two short DNA fragments (katGp1 and katGp2) of the katG promoter (Fig. S4A).
As shown in Fig. S4B, OxyS could form specific protein/DNA complexes with the substrates katGp and katGp2.
In contrast, no binding activity was observed for the substrate katGp1.
In addition, unlabeled katGp and katGp2 could competitively inhibit the binding of OxyS with the labeled DNA substrate, while unlabeled katGp1 had no effect on OxyS binding (Fig. S4C).
This indicates that the -1 to -180 region (katGp2) of the katG promoter contains the binding site for OxyS.

Two fragments - foot1 and foot2 - were further designed (Fig. S4A) to precisely determine the binding sites for OxyS in the katG promoter by DNase I footprinting assays.
As shown in Fig. 3A, the foot1 and foot2 fragments were incubated with increasing amounts of the OxyS protein and digested with DNase I.
Several regions were protected from digestion in the presence of the OxyS protein (Fig. 3A).
Two OxyS binding boxes, named OxyS box1 and OxyS box2, were further found in the protected regions, as indicated in Fig. 3B.
The core OxyS binding sites of M. tuberculosis katG also contained the LysR-binding motif T-N11-A, which has previously been shown to be a classic LTTR box [18].

A blast assay for the binding sequence for OxyS (OxyS box1) among different mycobacterial species revealed a conserved, GC-rich T-N11-A motif (G[C]TGC[T]CTGA[G]CNC[G]C [G]C[G]T[G]CGGACG[C]AC[T]A[G]A[G]) (Fig. 3C).
Specific binding of OxyS to the motif was then confirmed by base replacement and EMSA assays.
As shown in Fig. 3D, when the conserved "TG" and "GA" in OxyS box1 were replaced by "CC", the OxyS protein lost its ability to bind to the mutant DNA substrate as evidenced by the result of our EMSA assay that specific protein/DNA complexes were observed for the wild type substrate (Fig. 3D, left panel), but no such complex was observed for the mutant substrate (Fig. 3D, right panel).



The DNA-binding ability of OxyS is inhibited by H2O2 and Cys25 is a regulatory residue

We assayed the effect of redox reagents on the DNA-binding ability of OxyS.
As shown in Fig. 4A, a stepwise decrease in amounts of the specific protein/DNA complex was observed as 0.01 - 3 mM H2O2 was added to the DNA-binding reaction mixture (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 - 5).
In contrast, no effect was observed when DTT (dithiothreitol) was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 - 10), indicating that the ability of OxyS to bind DNA was specifically reduced by H2O2.
We also examined the expression level of katG in the M. smegmatis strain under oxidative stress (due to OxyS over-expression) by qRT-PCR assays.
As shown in Fig. 4B, the expression level of katG increased 2-fold after 2 mM H2O2 treatment, indicating that the negative regulation of katG by OxyS was eliminated.

The OxyS protein contains four cysteines (Fig. 1B), and two of them (Cys25 and Cys113) were found to be conserved among several mycobacterial OxyS orthologs (Fig. S1).
Cysteine residues have been shown to be responsible for redox-sensing in many transcriptional regulators [20] - [22].
To identify the sites responsible for sensing oxidative stress in OxyS, site-directed mutations were introduced into these cysteine residues in the oxyS gene.
The mutant proteins were expressed and successfully purified from an E. coli expression system (Fig. S3).
As shown in Fig. 4C, all the mutant proteins maintained their DNA-binding ability when compared with wild-type protein.
We examined the effect of these mutations on the ability of OxyS to bind to DNA in response to H2O2.
Cys113, Cys124 and Cys293 mutations did not change the sensitivity of OxyS to H2O2 (Fig. 4D).
Interestingly, the DNA-binding activity of the mutant protein OxyS-Cys25A, in which the mutation was situated in the DNA-binding domain of OxyS, was not affected by H2O2 (Fig. 4D) indicating that it lacked the ability to respond to the oxidative signal.
These results indicate that the Cys25 residue is involved in the regulation of the DNA-binding ability of OxyS under oxidative stress, while the other three cysteine residues are dispensable.

The fate of OxyS and its mutant variants after peroxide treatment was further determined by native-PAGE assays.
As shown in Fig. S6, addition of 3 mM H2O2 (lane 3) changed the electrophoretic mobility of OxyS and all its mutant variants.
In contrast, addition of 3 mM DTT (lane 2) neither altered the electrophoretic pattern nor changed the electrophoretic mobility of MSMEG_6092, a DNA binding protein from M. smegmatis with no cysteine residues (Fig. S6).
These results indicate that purified OxyS proteins are in a reduced state and are capable of redox-sensing.

Taken together, our results lend support to a model in which all the cysteine residues in OxyS can sense oxidative signal, but Cys25 is the only regulatory cysteine residue capable of both sensing the oxidative signal and regulating the ability of OxyS to bind to DNA under oxidative stress.



OxyS-Cys25A lacks the ability to respond to the oxidative signal in vivo in M. smegmatis

We first examined the effect of over-expressing OxyS on oxidative stress response in M. smegmatis using a modified bacterial growth time course assay.
As shown in Fig. 5A, we observed that the M. smegmatis strains over-expressing OxyS were more sensitive to H2O2 as 2 - 5 mM H2O2 was added to the medium if compared with the control strain.
This is consistent with a previous observation [17].
The findings of our detailed bacterial growth time course assays with increasing concentrations of H2O2 also support the same conclusion (Fig. S7).
As shown above, overexpression of OxyS lowered expression of the katG gene in M. smegmatis (Fig. 1D) and OxyS-Cys25 is a regulatory cysteine residue (Fig. 4D).
Thus, we further compared the DNA-binding ability of mutant OxyS proteins with that of the wild type protein for the promoter of katG in vivo in response to H2O2.
As shown in Fig. 5B, when over-expression of OxyS-WT or OxyS-C113A in M. smegmatis, the signal for katG promoter with 2 mM H2O2 treatment was reduced substantially in the anti-OxyS immunoprecipitate if compared with that in the control sample without H2O2 treatment.
In contrast, no obvious signal change for the enriched katG promoter in response to H2O2 was observed for over-expression of OxyS-C25A (Fig. 5B).
Therefore, the mutant protein OxyS-Cys25A lacked the ability to respond to the oxidative signal in vivo in M. smegmatis.
