ColR (PP0901) regulates the expression of PP0903

The expression of genes downstream of colRS operon is regulated by ColR in P. fluorescens [11].
This region of genome is well conserved among Pseudomonas bacteria [5] and therefore we presumed that the operon downstream of colRS (Fig. 1a) could be regulated by ColRS system in P. putida as well.
This downstream operon consists of three genes (Fig. 1a).
The first two, PP0903 coding for a putative methyltransferase and PP0904 coding for a lipopolysaccharide kinase InaA, are conserved among all 15 fully sequenced pseudomonads [5].
Putative orthologs of the third open reading frame PP0905 encoding for a hypothetical protein are present downstream of inaA in 13 sequenced members of Pseudomonas genus.
In order to test whether these genes belong to ColR regulon in P. putida, we cloned the upstream region of PP0903 in front of lacZ gene in a promoter probe plasmid p9TTBlacZ and compared plasmid-encoded beta-galactosidase activities in wild-type P. putida strain PaW85 and in its ColR-deficient derivative.
Our unpublished results show that ColR-dependent phenotypes are more pronounced on solid medium if compared to that in liquid medium.
Therefore, all enzyme activities presented in this study were measured from solid-medium-grown bacteria.
The obtained data showed that ColR is a positive effector of PP0903 expression since beta-galactosidase activity was comparable to the basal level of promoter probe vector p9TTBlacZ in a colR-deficient strain but was 10-fold higher in a wild-type strain (Fig. 1b).
As our previous study showed that ColR-regulated oprQ and algD promoters were affected by phenol [8], the beta-galactosidase activity was also measured in the presence of phenol.
Again, the activity of PP0903 promoter remained indistinguishable from the basal level of vector in the colR-mutant strain (Fig. 1b).
However, phenol significantly enhanced the activity of PP0903 promoter in a wild-type strain where ColR is present (Fig. 1b).
To confirm the role of ColR in the activation of PP0903 promoter, beta-galactosidase measurements were also performed in colR-mutant derivative PaWRtaccolR where the expression of ColR was inducible from Ptac promoter with addition of IPTG.
The activity of PP0903 promoter was already recovered in PaWRtaccolR strain without the induction of colR (Fig. 1b).
This was expected as immunoblot analysis of ColR expression had previously revealed significant leakiness of Ptac promoter in that particular strain [7].
Over-expression of ColR resulted in a strong enhancement of PP0903 promoter over the wild-type level both on glucose and glucose plus phenol medium (Fig. 1b).
Hence, response regulator ColR is indeed necessary for up-regulation of PP0903 promoter in P. putida.
Strong induction of the promoter by ColR over-expression suggests that either the amount of ColR is limiting in the wild-type cells or the ColS-activating signal is low in tested conditions.
Data also imply that the impact of ColR on the PP0903 activation becomes more prominent in bacteria experiencing phenol-caused stress.



ColR binding sites in the promoter regions of oprQ (PP0268) and PP0903

One possible way to find new target genes of a transcriptional regulator is to computationally analyze the whole genome of an organism.
As a certain binding consensus of a transcription factor is needed for that, we aimed to specify the exact binding sites of ColR in the promoters under its control.
Our previous paper demonstrated that purified histidine-tagged ColR bound in vitro to the promoters of oprQ and algD in a gel mobility shift assay [8].
Similar analysis with PP0903 promoter showed that ColR also directly interacts with this promoter DNA.
In order to map the ColR binding sites we performed a DNase I footprinting assay to the DNAs of oprQ, algD and PP0903 promoter fragments labelled with P32.
Fig. 2a illustrates the ColR-recognized regions in the promoters of oprQ and PP0903.
ColR protected a 24-to-26-bp-long area in both promoters (Fig. 2b) depending on a strand analysed.
ColR binding sites reside about 190 and 60 nucleotides upstream of translation start codons of oprQ and PP0903, respectively.
The binding of ColR to PP0903 promoter resulted in the appearance of a hypersensitive site for DNase I just next to the ColR-protected region (Fig. 2a).
Data also showed that the phosphorylated form of ColR (ColR~P) binds to the DNA with higher affinity than the unphosphorylated ColR.
However, the effect of phosphorylation was stronger in case of PP0903 compared to oprQ (Fig. 2a).

Despite the fact that ColR bound to the promoter DNA of algD in a gel mobility shift assay [8] we could not detect a ColR-binding site in this DNA by DNase I footprinting (data not shown).
This suggests that the binding dynamics of response regulator ColR could be somewhat different if algD promoter is compared to the promoters of oprQ and PP0903.
Most probably ColR recognition sequences in the algD promoter diverge from ColR consensus (see Discussion).



Computer search for potential ColR binding sites revealed several new ColR-regulated genes

Comparison of ColR recognition sequences in the promoters of oprQ and PP0903 (Fig. 2b) shows clearly that these two sequences are similar.
The most obvious common feature is a central T-track, 5-bp and 7-bp long in case of oprQ and PP0903, respectively (Fig. 2b).
In total 10 identical nucleotides are present in these two ColR binding sites allowing to deduce a 13-bp-long consensus motif for ColR binding - ACGNNTTTTTNAC.
High similarity of the two ColR binding boxes suggested that a genome-wide computer search could reveal new potential target genes of ColR.
Thus, sequences similar to identified ColR binding sites were searched from the genome of P. putida KT2440 using two free-access web-servers, PredictRegulon [12,13] and Virtual Footprint [14,15].
Several inquiries with varying input sequence length and strand orientation were performed.
Results of both programmes were compared and identical hits were chosen for experimental validation.
Actually, the prediction and identification of new ColR binding sites presented below was a step-by-step process meaning that new predictions were made with every additional confirmed ColR binding site (see Methods).
For experimental evaluation of the computer-predicted putative ColR-regulated promoters, they were cloned into a promoter probe plasmid p9TTBlacZ upstream of the lacZ gene.
If a predicted ColR-binding site was located between two divergently transcribed genes, then this DNA region was cloned upstream of the reporter in both orientations (promoters of PP0035/0036, PP0900/0901 and PP2560/2561).
beta-galactosidase activities were measured in wild-type and ColR-deficient P. putida cells grown overnight on glucose and glucose plus phenol solid media.
Additionally, since promoter activity of PP0903 was strongly enhanced by over-expression of ColR (Fig. 1b) all promoters were tested also in a P. putida strain PaWRtaccolR where the expression of ColR can be induced from Ptac promoter.
Results of beta-galactosidase assay show that promoters of PP0035, PP0036, PP0737, PP0900, PP1636, PP2560 and PP3766 are responsive to the absence and/or to the over-expression of ColR (Fig. 3).
All promoters except PP0737 are positively affected by ColR.
If promoters were tested in the presence of 2.5 mM phenol then the effects of ColR-deficiency and over-expression became more evident in case of most promoters.
For instance, while promoters of PP0036, PP0900, PP1636, PP2560 and PP3766 were only barely affected by the absence of ColR in the glucose-grown cells, then the impact of ColR upon these promoters became obvious in the glucose plus phenol-grown bacteria.
It is also remarkable that all promoters analysed responded significantly more to the over-expression than to the absence of ColR.
Namely, ColR over-expression clearly enhanced the activities of promoters that are under its positive control (Fig. 3).
Especially drastic activation was seen in case of PP0035 where over-expressed ColR caused 30-fold increase in the promoter activity when compared to that in a wild-type strain (Fig 3).
At the same time, the activity of PP0035 promoter was only 3-fold lower in glucose-grown colR mutant than in wild-type.
Analogous to that, the over-expression of ColR lowered the activity of negatively ColR-affected PP0737 promoter about 3-fold but the lack of ColR affected this particular promoter less than 2-fold (Fig. 3).
This data strongly suggest that either ColR amount is limiting in wild-type P. putida to affect significantly the expression of analysed target promoters or the signal perceived and transduced by ColS is low under the conditions employed by us.

It is important to point out that one new ColR-regulated gene, PP0900, locates just upstream of colRS genes and is transcribed divergently from PP0901 encoding colR (Fig. 1a).
Thus, the putative ColR-binding site affecting the expression of PP0900 is actually located between PP0900 and colR.
Analysis of this particular promoter in the direction of colR (PP0901) did not reveal clear ColR-responsiveness under any conditions examined (Fig. 3).
Therefore we conclude that ColR does not auto-regulate its own expression.



ColR binding sites in the promoters of predicted target genes

We aimed to confirm that in silico predicted ColR binding sites upstream of different genes, which expression was ColR-dependent in vivo, could really bind ColR.
For that purpose, we performed a DNase I footprinting analysis to six promoter regions that were tested in a beta-galactosidase assay (Fig. 3).
Figure 4a shows ColR protection patterns of five different promoter regions - PP0035/0036, PP0737, PP0900/0901, PP2560/2561 and PP3766.
The length of ColR-protected area varied between the promoters analysed ranging from 18-bp in one strand of PP0737 up to 46-bp in PP3766 (Fig. 4b).
Phosphorylation of ColR by ColS significantly increased its affinity to DNAs upstream of PP0900/0901, PP2560/2561 and PP3766.
The binding of ColR to several promoter DNAs changed the DNase I digestion pattern revealing new hypersensitive sites for DNase.
Paradoxically, ColR could not affect the DNase I digestion pattern of the PP1636 promoter (data not shown), although, this promoter was influenced by ColR in vivo (Fig. 3) and ColR binding to this DNA was clearly detectable in a gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 5).
It is noteworthy that the same was seen in case of ColR-regulated algD promoter (see above).
Thus, performed footprint analysis could not reveal all ColR binding sites in the promoters of its target genes.
Nevertheless, data presented in Fig. 4 verifies that ColR indeed binds to the computationally predicted sites in five new ColR-responsive promoters.



ColR binding consensus and potential regulon

The sequences of seven ColR binding sites identified by DNase I footprinting analysis (Fig. 2 and Fig. 4) were aligned to define a more precise ColR binding consensus than initial one, which was deduced only from two binding motifs detected in the promoters of oprQ and PP0903.
The length of the region protected by ColR varied significantly in different promoters (Fig. 2 and Fig. 4).
Therefore, rather long DNA fragments (presented in Table 1) were compared in order to find out whether sequences surrounding the core ColR-recognition site are conserved as well.
Fig. 6 demonstrates a ColR binding consensus created using WebLogo server [16].
In the middle of the sequence a well-conserved 16-bp-long core with 8 totally conserved positions is present, whereas most of the distant positions are much less conserved.
Therefore, only the core region was defined as a final ColR binding consensus ((T/C)(T/C)NA(C/G)NN(T/C)TTTTT(C/G)AC).
Next, this 16-bp-long core was used to predict minimal regulon of ColRS system.
41 ColR binding motif-resembling sites were extracted from P. putida genome by searching the upstream regions (500 bp upstream of the translation start) of all genes using a PredictRegulon server tool.
As several binding sites locate between divergently transcribed genes one may assume that ColR regulon potentially consists of more than 50 different genes (see Additional file 1).
However, whilst the first 11 sites of prediction match perfectly with 7 input sequences, the rest of the matches score lower than the cut-off value (6.76929 in our prediction; see Additional file 1).
Therefore, they should be considered as potential novel ColR sites, which should be confirmed experimentally.
It is notable that three genes (PP1692, PP2322 and PP2323) predicted as ColR-regulated possess two potential ColR-binding sites in their promoter regions (Additional file 1).
There are genes of different functions in the predicted regulon of ColRS two-component system (Additional file 1), but in accordance with previous results, this signal system seems to regulate many membrane associated functions.
Namely, 56% of putative ColR binding sites locate upstream of genes implicated in various membrane functions.
Furthermore, inspection of the first 26 sites shows that even 87% of them locate upstream of genes coding for membrane proteins (Additional file 1).
It is also remarkable that about one third of the putative members of ColR regulon code for hypothetical proteins (Additional file 1).
