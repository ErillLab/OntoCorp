Construction and characterization of a fur mutant strain

The C. crescentus genome contains two members of the Fur family of metalloregulators, Fur and Zur, putatively involved in iron and zinc homeostasis, respectively, and a Fe-S cluster biogenesis repressor IscR (18); however, no orthologs of iron-responsive regulators present in other alpha-proteobacteria, such as Irr and RirA are found (15).
To determine the role of Fur in C. crescentus, the fur-deleted strain SP0057 was generated by allelic exchange using a suicide vector after a two-step recombination into C. crescentus NA1000 strain.
The absence of the Fur protein in SP0057 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with an anti-Fur antiserum, and expression was restored after complementation with the gene carried in plasmid pMR20-Fur (Figure 1A).
The fur mutant formed smaller colonies than wild-type strain when grown on PYE solid medium for two days at 30 degrees C and the size of the colonies was restored in the complemented mutant strain (data not shown).
To further analyze this apparent slower growth of SP0057, we have evaluated the growth curves of the three strains.
The fur mutant displayed a slower growth rate at exponential phase in PYE medium than the wild-type strain and reached similar cell density at stationary phase.
The complemented strain revealed the same growth characteristics as the wild-type strain, demonstrating that the growth deficiency of the fur mutant was totally complemented (Figure 1B).

The absence of proper control over iron metabolism can cause as a secondary effect a difficulty in coping with oxidative stress, not only because this is generated in the presence of iron via the Fenton reaction, but also because several oxidative stress response enzymes need iron as a cofactor.
The oxidative stress response of SP0057 was analyzed after exposure to the oxidative agents H2O2, paraquat and tert-butyl hydroperoxide.
Increased sensitivity of SP0057 to H2O2 was demonstrated by larger zones of inhibition compared to strain NA1000 in a plate assay (Table 2).
This difference was evident for lawns starting with cells from both exponential and stationary phase cells, and the phenotype was complemented by the fur gene in trans.
The response to superoxide was not affected, as determined by cell viability assay in the presence of paraquat (Figure 2A), but the mutant was extremely sensitive to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (Figure 2B), indicating that it may be impaired in responding to organic hydroperoxides.
These results suggest that the absence of fur in C. crescentus affects more notably the oxidative stress response generated by hydroperoxides than by superoxide.




Weight matrix prediction of C. crescentus candidate Fur-binding sites

As an effort to identify genes directly regulated by Fur, we implemented an iterative approach using different weight matrices to locate potential Fur-binding sites in the C. crescentus genome.
Initially, the C. crescentus genome sequence was scanned using a weight matrix derived from a set of predicted C. crescentus Fur-binding sites detected in an ab initio comparative genomic analysis of multiple alpha-proteobacteria genomes (16).
Of the several potential Fur-binding sites detected in this initial analysis (data not shown), 11 sequences were experimentally validated (Figure 3) and used to obtain a more confident motif model.
The complete list of the predictions obtained by searching the C. crescentus genome with this refined weight matrix is in Supplementary Table S2.
This data set contained almost all predicted sites of the initial search and all experimentally confirmed sites used for matrix construction.
Predicted Fur-binding sites with scores >10 and their associated genes are summarized in Table 3.
To obtain a more realistic estimative of the total of genes regulated by Fur, the genes associated with Fur-binding sites were analyzed with regard to their organization in putative operons (Table 3).


As a rule, we find one predicted Fur-binding site for each gene; however, some present more than one, such as genes CC0001, CC0029, CC0179, CC0228, CC0682, CC1063, CC1362, CC2193, CC2194, CC2367, CC3208 and CC3264 that possess two sites each and gene CC0028 with four putative Fur-binding sites in its promoter region (Table S2).
It is also worth noticing that at least 12 predicted Fur-binding sites were detected in promoter regions of divergent genes (as indicated in Table 3) and this binding might or not affect expression of both genes simultaneously.

Consistent with the definition for a global regulator, Fur-binding sites with high scores are present in genes belonging to diverse functional categories, such as transport and iron uptake systems, energy metabolism (iron-containing enzymes) and transcription regulation among others.
Some of these categories will be discussed below.

Many of the genes associated with Fur-binding sites are involved with iron uptake systems.
Four genes encoding TonB-dependent receptors (CC0028, CC0139, CC2194 and CC2928), as well as others encoding proteins of transport systems belonging to different families showed high scores for predicted Fur-binding sites, suggesting that they may be involved in iron transport (Table 3).
Additionally, low-score Fur-binding sites (scores >5 and <7.5) were also found in front of four more genes encoding TonB-dependent receptors (CC0185, CC1136, CC1666 and CC3161) and of the exbBD-tonB1 (CC2336) and feoAB (CC0711) operons (Table S2).
A possible Fur-binding site is also present in the promoter region of its own gene (CC0057, score 7.26), suggesting that the C. crescentus fur gene is transcriptionally autoregulated, as it has been reported for other bacteria (1).

Predicted Fur-binding sites were identified upstream of several genes and/or operons encoding important iron-containing enzymes that are involved in energy metabolism, such as NADH dehydrogenase (nuo), succinate dehydrogenase (sdh), aconitate hydratase (acnA), cytochrome c oxidase (CC3402) and ATP synthase (CC0367 and CC3450).
Fur-binding sites were also detected upstream of three genes encoding putative ferredoxins: CC3208 (ferredoxin-NADP reductase), CC0068 (ferredoxin, Rieske 2Fe-2S family) and CC3263 (ferredoxin bfd).
Although the bfd gene is adjacent to bfr gene (CC3262, encoding the iron storage bacterioferritin), they are not probably cotranscribed.
In fact, our search did not detect Fur-binding sites in none of the two ferritins (Bfr and Dps) encoded in the C. crescentus genome.



Experimental validation of predicted Fur-binding sites by EMSA and footprinting analysis

To evaluate the functionality of the predicted Fur-binding sites detected by our in silico analysis, 11 regulatory regions of selected genes were PCR-amplified and used in a gel mobility shift assay with the C. crescentus purified Fur protein.
As it can be observed in Figure 3A, all the tested probes were shifted in the presence of up to 500 nM Fur in a dose-dependent manner.
The specificity of Fur binding was demonstrated, since complete loss of the shift was observed when excess unlabeled DNA probe was used as specific competitor (Figure 3A, S lanes) but not with an unlabeled non-specific DNA (Figure 3A, N lanes).
As an additional control, it was demonstrated that the Fur protein did not bind to a DNA probe of similar size corresponding to the fur-coding region even if 1 muM Fur was used.
The assay also allowed a rough estimate of the relative Fur-binding affinity for each fragment, with genes dnaN, nuo and sdh showing the lowest affinities.
Therefore, EMSA experiments confirmed in vitro specific binding of the Fur regulator to all 11 tested DNA fragments containing predicted Fur-binding sites.

As a second validation of the specific binding of Fur, the predicted Fur-binding sites present at the nuo and sdh regulatory regions were mutated, exchanging five of the conserved base pairs for a different sequence.
As shown in Figure 3B, the fragments containing the altered sites were no longer retarded in EMSA, confirming that this conserved region is essential for Fur binding to these fragments.

Most of these validated Fur-binding sites are located in regulatory regions of divergent genes (Table 3).
Admitting its control on each pair of divergent genes, we have confirmed Fur-binding sites controlling expression of at least 19 different genes and/or operons.
Among them are genes known to be regulated by Fur in other organisms such as the ferrous iron transporter feoAB, several TonB-dependent receptors for ferri - siderophore transport (CC0028, CC0139, CC2194 and CC2928), the ferredoxin bfd and a variety of genes encoding iron-using enzymes (acnA, sdhCDAB, nuoA-N and gltDB).

The sdh and CC2194 regulatory regions were further analyzed by DNase I footprinting assay to determine the actual sequence of Fur binding (Figure 4).
Probes consisting of the sdh and CC2194 promoter regions were radiolabelled at one extremity, incubated with increasing amounts of Fur protein and digested with DNase I.
A region corresponding to positions - 102 to - 80 with respect to translational start site of the sdh gene was protected by the Fur protein.
Interestingly, for the CC2194 gene, two regions encompassing positions - 120 to - 87 and - 46 to - 22 with respect to the start codon were protected.
Consistent with these two protected regions, two Fur-binding sites were predicted by the in silico analysis for the CC2194 gene, although only the most upstream one was highly scored.
In conclusion, the nucleotide sequences of these three protected regions correspond to the three predicted Fur-binding sites, confirming a correct prediction of the C. crescentus Fur-binding site by our in silico analysis.




The role of Fur on controlling expression of genes with predicted Fur-binding sites

To determine the effect of Fur in gene expression in vivo, some of the promoter regions of genes with validated Fur-binding sites were cloned in front of a lacZ reporter gene and plasmids containing each transcriptional fusion were introduced into the wild-type NA1000 strain and into the fur mutant strain.
Expression driven by each promoter was assessed by measuring beta-galactosidase activity in the presence of either 100 muM FeSO4 or 100 muM of the iron chelator 2,2-dipyridyl (Figure 5A).
The results showed that the expression driven by the sdhC, acnA and nuoA promoters was diminished in the presence of dipyridyl and in the fur mutant strain, indicating that these genes are activated by Fur in the presence of iron.
The TonB-dependent receptors-encoding genes CC0139, CC0028, CC2928 and CC2194, as well as the feoAB operon, were induced in the presence of dipyridyl in the wild-type strain and constitutively derepressed in the fur mutant strain independently of iron, indicating that Fur represses these genes in response to high iron level.
As a control, expression of CC2194 was also determined in the Fur complemented strain.
The iron-dependent repression of the CC2194 gene was completely restored in this strain.


The results indicated that the sdh, nuo and acnA genes were activated by Fur, showing about 2-fold higher expression in the NA1000 strain than in the SP0057 strain.
In order to determine whether this increase in expression was directly driven by the binding of Fur to the promoter, lacZ expression was determined from transcriptional fusions carrying the nuo and sdh promoter regions with mutated Fur binding sites (Figure 5B).
The results showed that the mutated promoters were unable to generate the levels of expression observed with the original promoters in the wild-type strain.
In fact, those levels were similar to those obtained with the original promoters in the fur mutant strain.
These results confirm that the activation of the nuo and sdh genes in vivo is dependent on Fur binding to the predicted Fur-binding sites.

Transcriptional start sites previously determined (39) were used to analyze the position of some verified Fur-binding sites in relation to the promoter region of the respective genes (Figure 6).
The Fur-binding sites of genes nuoA, sdhC and acnA are found upstream of the deduced - 35 promoter regions, consistent with them being activated by Fur, as verified by gene expression assays (Figure 5).
On the other hand, the Fur-binding sites of genes CC0139, CC0028, CC2928, C2194 and feoA are located overlapping or downstream of the RNA polymerase binding site, suggesting transcriptional repression by steric hindrance.
In fact, all these genes were repressed by Fur in response to high iron level (Figure 5A).
Thus, transcription start sites correlated well with - 35 and - 10 promoter elements and with predicted Fur-binding sites, except for sdhC.
In this gene, the proposed transcriptional start site was found between the - 35 and - 10 elements of an excellent C. crescentus sigma70 consensus (TTGAC-16-CCTANA) and the role of Fur as activator indicates that the Fur-binding site is correctly positioned with regard to this consensus, indicating that the transcriptional start site is probably a few base pairs downstream.


DNA sequence logos were derived from the 11 Fur-binding sites verified in vitro and from all predicted Fur-binding sites with score >7.5, and are represented in Figure 7.
The consensus sequence contains a 19-bp palindromic motif (9-1-9 inverted repeat) that is highly similar to the previously described Furalpha-box predicted for several alpha-proteobacteria (16).
Interestingly, this Fur-binding motif resembles two unknown motifs (motif cc_13 and motif m_3) identified in a global analysis for novel regulatory signals in C. crescentus (39).
The cc_13 motif was identified in a cluster of genes presenting the same cell cycle pattern of expression (39).
In fact, almost all the genes belonging to motif cc_13 were also identified in our search and were shown to be negatively regulated by Fur.
These genes showed an increase in expression in the late predivisional cell (39), which is consistent with the fact that synthesis of Fur was reported to be higher in the stalked cell and decreasing in the predivisional cell (40).
The motif m_3 was found in genes with similar metal response pattern of expression (39), but in this case some genes belonging to that cluster (CC1956, CC3529 and CC3667) were positively regulated by Fur.
