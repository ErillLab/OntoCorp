Differences in antimicrobial susceptibility patterns between A56-1S and A56-1R

We selected the MEM-resistant E. coli strain A56-1R from A56-1S by culturing on LB agar supplemented with 1 mg/L MEM (Table 1).
The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of A56-1S and A56-1R were tested using the agar dilution method and a Vitek2 instrument (Table 3).
A56-1S was resistant to CAZ, CTX, GEN, CIP and SXT, and exhibited high or intermediate susceptibility to IPM, MEM, AMK and FOF (Table 3).
The antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of A56-1R was similar to that of A56-1S with the exception of its response to CAZ, IPM and MEM (Table 3).
For example, the MEM MIC of A56-1R was over 256-fold higher than that of A56-1S.
Both A56-1S and A56-1R tested positive for blaIMP-6 and blaCTX-M via PCR amplification.



Differences in IMP-6 MBL production and blaIMP-6 transcript levels between A56-1S and A56-1R

Differences in carbapenemase expression between A56-1S and A56-1R was tested by qRT-PCR of blaIMP-6 and the Carba NP test.
The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the blaIMP-6 transcript level was 53-fold higher in A56-1R compared to A56-1S (Fig 1A).
In the Carba NP test, A56-1S was negative and A56-1R was positive for carbapenemase production (Fig 1B).
Therefore, carbapenemase production by these strains correlate with the observed meropenem susceptibility (Table 3).



Comparative genome analysis between A56-1S and A56-1R

To analyze the difference in blaIMP-6 transcript levels between A56-1S and A56-1R, whole-genome sequencing was performed using NGS.
The chromosomal and plasmid DNA were separated by S1 nuclease PFGE, and one chromosomal and three plasmid bands were observed for both strains (data not shown).
We observed that the blaIMP-6-positive plasmids pA56-1S (GenBank ID: AP018362) and pA56-1R (GenBank ID: AP018363) were part of the IncN incompatibility group and carried other antimicrobial resistance genes (blaCTX-M-2, sul1, aadA2, tetA), a class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1), and a conjugative transfer operon (Fig 2).
Upstream of blaIMP-6 are located the promoters of intI1 and ardK on pA56-1S and pA56-1R, respectively (Fig 2).
A pairwise homology alignment showed that the proportion of homologous regions (at GTEQ 99% nucleotide identity) between pA56-1S and pKPI-6 of Klebsiella pneumoniae KPI-6 strain (GenBank ID: AB616660 [9]) was 90.6% (Fig 2), suggesting that these plasmids share a common backbone.

There is a 791-bp difference in sequence length between pA56-1S (53,198 bp) and pA56-1R (53,989 bp) due to an additional IS26 element that was transposed into the alleviation of restriction of DNA (ardK) coding sequence on pA56-1R, along with IS26-mediated inversion (Fig 2).
This additional IS26 element and the associated inversion caused disruption of the ardK gene, the product of which ArdK, is predicted to be a transcription factor belonging to the family of transcriptional repressor TrfB, as determined by its amino acid sequence using InterPro (similar to protein motif IPR032428).
No sequence variations were identified in the chromosomal and other blaIMP-6-negative plasmid sequences between A56-1S and A56-1R (data not shown).



Repression of IMP-6 MBL production by ArdK

To determine whether ArdK mutated by IS26 insertion is involved in blaIMP-6 expression, differences in IMP-6 MBL production between transformants with ArdK and mutated ArdK were analyzed using a blaIMP-6-based reporter assay.
The ardK genes and regions upstream of blaIMP-6 from pA56-1S (UPS) and pA56-1R (UPR) were cloned separately into plasmids and transformed into an E. coli OmniMAX laboratory strain free from IncN-related genes including ardK, UPS and UPR on pA56-1S/pA56-1R (Fig 3).
The transformants were tested using the Carba NP test and broth microdilution.
The transformant carrying UPS (Omni-UPS) was positive on the Carba NP test and showed a MEM MIC of > 32 mg/L, suggesting that Omni-UPS produced IMP-6 MBL (Fig 3).
The cotransformant with ardK (Omni-UPS_A) demonstrated negative results on the Carba NP test and MEM MIC of 0.25 - 0.5 mg/L, whereas the cotransformant with mutated ardK (Omni-UPS_mA) was positive on the Carba NP test and showed MEM MIC of > 32 mg/L (Fig 3), suggesting markedly reduced carbapenemase production in cotransformants carrying intact ardK.
in addition, the Carba NP test and MEM MIC for UPR suggest that ArdK can modulate the expression of blaIMP-6 in transformants carrying either UPS or UPR (Fig 3).



Characterization of the ArdK binding region on pA56-1S

The above results suggest that ArdK could repress the transcription of blaIMP-6 (Fig 3).
To identify the ArdK binding region upstream of blaIMP-6, EMSA was performed using a biotin-labeled DNA probe upstream of blaIMP-6 on pA56-1S.
Three ArdK binding sites CUP5, CUPA and CUPB have been previously reported as conserved upstream sequences involved in the regulation of ardB, ardK and repA, respectively, on the IncN plasmid [16].
Comparative analysis of the upstream region of blaIMP-6 and these three sequences showed that the 13 consensus nucleotides (CUPA56, 4812 - 4824 nt in pA56-1S) were well aligned (CUP5, 84.6%; CUPB, 84.6%; CUPA, 69.2%; Fig 4A).
A 107-bp DNA probe that included the consensus nucleotides labeled by biotin was amplified from pA56-1S, and EMSA was performed with the probe and recombinant ArdK (intact form on pA56-1S) or mArdK (C-terminus-deleted form on pA56-1R; Fig 4B).
The results showed that the band corresponding to the probe was shifted by ArdK binding but not by mArdK.
A nonspecific competition assay using a 30-fold weight excess of unlabeled mammalian genomic DNA showed that specific ArdK binding was retained as the band shift without competitor inhibition (Fig 4B).
The binding affinity of ArdK for the 107 bp DNA probe was analyzed using the Octet RED96 system, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) value was 2.93 +- 0.0673 x 10-8 M (Fig 4C).
