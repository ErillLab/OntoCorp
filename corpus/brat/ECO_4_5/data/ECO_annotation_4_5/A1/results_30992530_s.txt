Transcription of mafR under laboratory conditions

The genome of the E. faecalis strain OG1RF has been totally sequenced (GenBank CP002621.1)14.
By quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays and using the comparative CT method15, we determined the relative expression of the regulatory mafR gene (locus_tag OG1RF_12293) in cells grown under laboratory conditions (Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth, 37 degrees C, without aeration) to both logarithmic and stationary phases.
Transcription of mafR was found to be higher at logarithmic phase.
Compared to stationary phase, the fold change (log2FC) in mafR expression was ~4.
Therefore, all the experiments shown in this work were performed at the logarithmic growth phase.



Gene OG1RF_12294 encodes a putative P-type ATPase cation transporter

P-type ATPases constitute a large superfamily of cation and lipid pumps that use ATP hydrolysis for energy.
They are integral, multispanning membrane proteins that are found in bacteria and in a number of eukaryotic plasma membranes and organelles16.
The enterococcal OG1RF_12294 gene, which is adjacent to mafR (Fig. 1A), encodes a putative P-type ATPase cation transporter.
Such a gene has been annotated as pmr1 (GeneID: 12289043) because it encodes a protein (850 amino acids) that has sequence similarity (~52%) to eukaryotic PMR1 (plasma membrane ATPase related) P-type ATPases (Supplementary Table S1).
Some PMR1-type pumps are able to transport calcium, as well as manganese, into the Golgi apparatus17 - 19.

In addition to OG1RF_12294, the OG1RF genome encodes two putative calcium-transporting ATPases: OG1RF_10600 and OG1RF_11602 (Supplementary Table S2).
Using the BLASTP protein sequence alignment program20, we found that OG1RF_12294 has sequence similarity (~53 - 56%) to both ATPases (Supplementary Table S1).
Furthermore, OG1RF_12294 has sequence similarity (~53 - 56%) to several prokaryotic proteins characterized as calcium P-type ATPases (Supplementary Table S1)21 - 25.
Thus, protein OG1RF_12294 might contribute to maintain calcium homeostasis in enterococcal cells.



MafR influences positively the transcription of OG1RF_12294

To analyse whether MafR regulates the expression of the OG1RF_12294 gene, we determined its relative expression in OG1RF (wild-type) and OG1RFDeltamafR (deletion mutant) by qRT-PCR.
The log2FC in OG1RF_12294 expression due to the presence of MafR was ~3, indicating that MafR has a positive effect on the transcription of such a gene.
This conclusion was further confirmed by increasing the intracellular level of MafR.
Specifically, we determined the relative expression of OG1RF_12294 in two strains: OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLF (absence of MafR) and OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLFmafR (plasmid-encoded MafR).
In addition, we determined the relative expression of the OG1RF_10600 and OG1RF_11602 genes, which encode putative calcium-transporting ATPases (Supplementary Table S1).
In the presence of plasmid-encoded MafR, only transcription of OG1RF_12294 was increased (log2FC ~4).
Thus, MafR influences positively and specifically the transcription of the OG1RF_12294 gene.



MafR activates the P12294 promoter in vivo

In the OG1RF genome14, the ATG codon at coordinate 2425611 is likely the translation start site of the OG1RF_12294 gene (Fig. 1A).
It is preceded by a putative ribosome binding site sequence (AGGAGG).
Upstream of such a sequence there is a putative promoter (here named P12294) that has a canonical -10 element (TATAAT) but lacks a potential -35 element (consensus TTGACA) at the optimal length of 17 nucleotides.
Nevertheless, there is a near-consensus -35 element (TCGACC) at the suboptimal spacer length of 22 nucleotides.
These features suggested that promoter P12294 could be recognized by a sigma factor similar to the Escherichia coli sigma70 and that its activity could be enhanced by regulatory proteins.
Sequence analysis of the region located between the TAA stop codon of the OG1RF_12295 gene (coordinate 2425761) and the P12294 promoter revealed the existence of an inverted-repeat (IR) that may function as a Rho-independent transcriptional terminator (Fig. 1A).

To characterize the P12294 promoter, a 255-bp DNA fragment (coordinates 2425885 to 2425631) (Fig. 2) was inserted into the pASTT promoter-probe vector, which is based on the gfp reporter gene.
The recombinant plasmid (pASTT-P12294) was first introduced into OG1RF and OG1RFDeltamafR.
In these strains, the expression of gfp (0.32 +- 0.02 and 0.26 +- 0.04 units, respectively) was similar to the basal level (OG1RF harbouring pASTT; 0.38 +- 0.02 units).
Different results were obtained when pASTT-P12294 was introduced into OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring either pDLF or pDLFmafR (plasmid-encoded MafR) (Fig. 2).
The expression of gfp was ~2.5-fold higher in the presence of plasmid-encoded MafR.
This result indicated that the 255-bp DNA fragment contains a MafR-dependent promoter activity.
Removal of the -10 element of the P12294 promoter resulted in loss of such an activity (plasmid pASTT-P12294Delta-10).
A further deletion analysis allowed us to conclude that the 186-bp region between coordinates 2425816 and 2425631 contains both the P12294 promoter and the site required for its activation by MafR (plasmids pASTT-P12294Delta69 and pASTT-P12294Delta208) (Fig. 2).



MafR binds to the P12294 promoter region in vitro

To investigate whether MafR activates directly the expression of the OG1RF_12294 gene, we performed DNase I footprinting experiments.
We used a His-tagged MafR protein (MafR-His) and a 270-bp DNA fragment (coordinates 2425817 to 2425548).
This fragment contains the P12294 promoter and the site required for its activation by MafR in vivo (Fig. 2).
The presence of a His-tag at the C-terminal end of MafR does not affect its DNA-binding properties4.
The 270-bp DNA fragment was radioactively labelled either at the 5'-end of the coding strand or at the 5'-end of the non-coding strand (Fig. 3).
On the coding strand and at 100 nM of MafR-His, protections against DNase I digestion were observed within the region spanning coordinates 2425708 and 2425658.
On the non-coding strand and at 125 nM of MafR-His, diminished cleavages were observed between coordinates 2425712 and 2425686.
Thus, MafR-His recognizes a site overlapping the -35 element of the P12294 promoter (Fig. 3).
This result allowed us to conclude that MafR activates directly the transcription of the OG1RF_12294 gene.

Figure 1B shows the bendability/curvature propensity plot of the 270-bp DNA fragment according to the bend.it program26.
The profile contains an intrinsic curvature of high magnitude (~13 degrees per helical turn), which is adjacent to the MafR binding site.
In addition, the site recognized by MafR contains a region of potential bendability (~5.2 units).



Gene OG1RF_11486 encodes a putative QueT transporter family protein

Energy-coupling factor (ECF) transporters are a family of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters that are responsible for the uptake of essential micronutrients in prokaryotes.
They consist of a membrane-embedded S-component that provides substrate specificity and a three-subunit ECF module that couples ATP hydrolysis to transport.
In the so-called group II ECF transporters, different S-components share the same ECF module.
Furthermore, the S-component genes are not located in the same operon as the genes for the ECF module27 - 29.

The enterococcal OG1RF_11486 gene encodes a putative QueT transporter family protein (GenBank AEA94173.1).
Proteins identical to OG1RF_11486 (173 residues) are encoded by Mycobacterium abscessus (CPW17925.1), Listeria monocytogenes (CWW42654.1; 172 up to 173 residues are identical) and S. agalactiae (KLL29182.1).
In the two former bacteria, the corresponding protein has been annotated as queuosine precursor ECF transporter S-component QueT.
Therefore, protein OG1RF_11486 could be involved in the uptake of a queuosine biosynthetic intermediate.
Using the BLASTP program20, we found that the OG1RF genome encodes an additional QueT transporter family protein (OG1RF_12031; 168 residues; AEA94718.1).
It has 55% of similarity to the OG1RF_11486 protein.



MafR activates the P11486 promoter in vivo

By qRT-PCR assays, we found that MafR has a positive effect on the transcription of OG1RF_11486.
Compared to strain OG1RFDeltamafR, the relative expression of OG1RF_11486 was slightly higher in strain OG1RF (log2FC ~0.9).
Moreover, the relative expression of OG1RF_11486 was higher in strain OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLFmafR (plasmid-encoded MafR) than in strain OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLF (log2FC ~2.4).

The BPROM program (Softberry, Inc.) predicts a promoter sequence (named P11486 herein) upstream of the OG1RF_11486 gene.
The -35 (TTTACA) and -10 (TAACAT) elements of this promoter are separated by 17 nucleotides (Fig. 4A).
By primer extension using total RNA from OG1RF cells, we demonstrated that the P11486 promoter is functional in vivo (Fig. 5).
Oligonucleotide R11486-D was used as primer (Table 1).
A cDNA product of 130 nucleotides was detected, indicating that transcription of OG1RF_11486 starts at coordinate 1543115 (Fig. 4A).

To further characterize the P11486 promoter, we constructed several transcriptional fusions (Fig. 6).
A 284-bp DNA fragment (coordinates 1542902 to 1543185) was inserted into pASTT.
The recombinant plasmid (pASTT-P11486) was first introduced into OG1RF and OG1RFDeltamafR.
In both strains, gfp expression (1.48 +- 0.10 and 1.51 +- 0.16 units, respectively) was ~4-fold higher than the basal level (OG1RF harbouring pASTT).
This result indicated that the 284-bp DNA fragment has promoter activity, however, the chromosomal copy of mafR is not sufficient to activate such a promoter located on pASTT (multicopy plasmid).
Next, we introduced pASTT-P11486 into OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLFmafR (plasmid-encoded MafR).
In this strain, gfp expression was ~3-fold higher than in the control strain (OG1RFDeltamafR harbouring pDLF) (Fig. 6).
Similar results were obtained with plasmids pASTT-P11486Delta66 and pASTT-P11486Delta145, which allowed us to conclude that the 139-bp region between coordinates 1543047 and 1543185 contains both the P11486 promoter and the site required for its activation by MafR.
A further deletion analysis showed that sequences between coordinates 1543047 and 1543071 (plasmid pASTT-P11486Delta169) are needed for MafR-mediated activation of the P11486 promoter but not for promoter activity.
Moreover, deletion of the region that spans coordinates 1543071 and 1543090 (plasmid pASTT-P11486Delta188) removes the -35 element of the P11486 promoter and, consequently, reduces the expression of gfp to basal levels (Fig. 6).



MafR binds to the P11486 promoter region in vitro

By DNase I footprinting assays, we analysed whether MafR-His binds to the P11486 promoter region (Fig. 7).
We used a 275-bp DNA fragment (coordinates 1542969 to 1543243), which contains both the P11486 promoter and the site required for its activation by MafR in vivo (Fig. 6).
On the coding strand and at 350 nM of MafR-His, changes in DNase I sensitivity (diminished cleavages) were observed within the region spanning coordinates 1543047 and 1543110.
On the non-coding strand and at 300 nM of MafR-His, diminished cleavages were observed between coordinates 1543043 and 1543110.
On both strands and at 400 nM of MafR-His, regions protected against DNase I digestion were observed along the DNA fragment, which is consistent with the ability of MafR-His to generate multimeric complexes4.
Therefore, MafR-His recognizes preferentially a DNA site overlapping the P11486 core promoter.
Such a DNA site includes sequences needed for MafR-mediated activation of the P11486 promoter in vivo (Fig. 6).
According to the bendability/curvature propensity plot of the 275-bp DNA fragment, the MafR binding site contains regions of potential bendability (Fig. 4B).
