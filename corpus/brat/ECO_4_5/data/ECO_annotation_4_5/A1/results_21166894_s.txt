pioABC expression is induced during anaerobic growth

To assess differences in the expression of the pioABC operon in R. palustris TIE-1, our first approach was to use quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR).
Comparison of the mRNA abundance of pioA, pioB and pioC under various growth conditions revealed that expression was lowest during aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth.
This condition was therefore used as a baseline to calculate the relative fold change in mRNA abundance.
Expression of the pioABC transcripts was highly upregulated during photoferrotrophic growth relative to aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth (Fig. 1A).
Interestingly, pioABC mRNA transcripts were in general higher during anaerobic phototrophic growth, although transcript levels were significantly higher under photoferrotrophic conditions.

To complement our qRT-PCR transcriptional data, we constructed an integrative lacZ reporter to determine the in vivo expression of the pioABC operon under various conditions.
The pioABC genes form an operon as shown previously (Jiao and Newman, 2007).
With the assumption that a single promoter drives the expression of the pioABC operon, we fused the entire intergenic region between pioA and the upstream gene Rpal_0818, in frame with the ATG start codon of the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli that encodes beta-galactosidase.
This led to formation of a lacZ translational fusion that was subsequently integrated onto the chromosome of WT R. palustris TIE-1.
The level of beta-galactosidase activity measured from this strain represented a combination of transcription and translation initiation.
Assessment of beta-galactosidase activity under various growth conditions revealed that there was no detectable activity of the pioABC operon during aerobic growth.
beta-Galactosidase activity was observed under all anaerobic growth conditions tested, being highest during photoferrotrophic growth (Fig. 1B).
beta-Galactosidase activity was 10-fold higher during photoferrotrophic growth compared with photoheterotrophic growth on succinate.
Overall, these data are qualitatively similar to what we observed with qRT-PCR.



The pioABC transcription start site is a guanine residue upstream of which lie two canonical FixK binding sites

The transcription start site (TSS) of the pioABC operon was determined during photoheterotrophic growth on succinate, photoautotrophic growth on H2 as well as photoferrotrophic growth on Fe(II).
cRACE and 5' RLM-RACE revealed that the TSS of the pioABC operon is a guanine residue 177 bp upstream of the predicted ATG start codon of pioA under all the growth conditions tested (Fig. 2 and Fig. S2).
5' RLM-RACE also revealed the presence of a processed site, which is an adenine residue 152 bp upstream of the predicted start codon.
This processed site might be important for regulation mediated either by regulatory proteins or other mechanisms.
A similar site has been observed in the E. coli yfiD promoter under the control of the Fnr protein (Green et al., 1998).
Assessment of the region near the TSS revealed the presence of -10 and -35 core promoter elements of which only the -10 resembles the E. colisigmaf70 consensus (McClure, 1985).
Centred at -44.5 is a canonical FixK box (named FixK I) assigning this promoter to a CRP/FNR class II promoter (Mesa et al., 2005).
Another canonical FixK box (FixK II) is centred at position -137.5.
Use of two identical binding sites has been observed for interaction of Fnr with the yfiD promoter and CRP interaction with the acsP2 promoter in E. coli (Green and Baldwin, 1997; Beatty et al., 2003).



Both identified FixK binding sites influence expression of the pioABC operon in vivo

To assess the importance of the canonical FixK binding sites conserved in the pioABC promoter, we constructed DNA templates lacking either FixK I or FixK II boxes and fused them in frame with lacZ, forming translational fusions.
These constructs were then integrated onto the chromosome of WT R. palustris TIE-1 and assayed for beta-galactosidase activity on various growth substrates.
Deletion of FixK I led to dramatic downregulation of beta-galactosidase activity on all the substrates tested (Fig. 3).
These data demonstrated that FixK I was important for activation of expression of the pioABC operon.
Only a modest downregulation of beta-galactosidase activity was observed when FixK II was deleted.
This suggests that although the primary DNA site that influences pioABC expression is FixK I, FixK II does play a role in activating pioABC expression.



deltafixK has a phototrophic iron oxidation defect and is severely impaired during anaerobic phototrophic growth

The identification of FixK binding sites in the pioABC promoter and the influence of these sites on pioABC expression implicated the FixK protein in controlling expression of this operon.
We thus deleted this gene (Rpal_4729) from the chromosome of the PpioA - lacZ translational fusion strain and confirmed the mutant using PCR (Fig. S3).
This deltafixK strain was then characterized with respect to phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation and defects in growth (Fig.4 and Table S1).
Comparison of the ability of deltafixK and WT R. palustris TIE-1 to oxidize Fe(II) phototrophically revealed that deltafixK was severely delayed in photoferrotrophic growth (Fig. 4).
WT R. palustris TIE-1 started oxidizing Fe(II)-NTA at ~ 120 h after inoculation while deltafixK showed first signs of Fe(II)-NTA oxidation at ~ 320 h post inoculation.
Eventually, both WT and deltafixK were able to oxidize 5 mM Fe(II) with 10 mM NTA to completion as well as achieve similar levels of total protein content.
The rate of Fe(II)-NTA oxidation by WT and deltafixK also appeared to be similar [~ 0.03 mM Fe(II)-NTA oxidized per hour].
No significant difference in lag time was observed between WT and deltafixK during aerobic growth on YP medium, although slight differences in generation time were detected (Table S1).
In contrast, a substantial increase in lag time was observed in deltafixK versus WT during anaerobic phototrophic growth in FW medium.
In general, the deltafixK mutant had lower pigmentation both during aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth as well as phototrophic growth (Fig. S4).
A similar defect was observed in R. palustris CGA009 and was attributed to production of lower amounts of reaction centre as well as light harvesting complexes 1 and 2 (LH1 and 2) (Rey and Harwood, 2010).
Moreover, the expression of genes for the LH1 complex (pufAB) was found to decrease slightly in the deltafixK mutant (Rey and Harwood, 2010).
Reasoning that the lower pigmentation in the R. palustris TIE-1 deltafixK mutant was likely due to similar expression changes, we next sought to determine whether the phototrophic Fe(II) oxidation defect was an indirect effect or due to a direct interaction between the pioABC promoter with FixK.



FixK affects expression of the pioABC operon

To assess whether FixK directly affects pioABC expression, we determined expression of this operon in deltafixK versus WT using qRT-PCR and translational reporter gene fusions (Fig. 5).
No significant difference was observed between pioABC transcripts levels in the deltafixK mutant versus WT during aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth on succinate (Fig. 5A).
However, expression of the pioABC genes increased in the deltafixK mutant versus WT under all the phototrophic conditions tested except during photoferrotrophic growth, when pioABC mRNA decreased in the mutant.
The translational fusion data coincided with the mRNA abundance data and showed that beta-galactosidase activity increased in the deltafixK mutant versus WT under most phototrophic conditions tested but decreased during photoferrotrophic growth.
The decrease in beta-galactosidase activity during photoferrotrophic growth was approximately fivefold.
The stability of the beta-galactosidase enzyme might account for the modest decrease in expression from the Ppio - lacZ fusion compared with the dramatic decrease in pioABC mRNA abundance.
Overall, these data suggest that FixK either directly or indirectly regulates expression of the pioABC operon in response to growth conditions.
The only condition we identified under which FixK activated pioABC expression was photoferrotrophy, whereas repression occurred on all other phototrophic conditions tested.
Complementation of the deltafixK mutant with either WT or N-terminal His6-tagged FixK resulted in partial restoration of pioABC expression as well as full restoration of FixK expression during photoferrotrophic growth (Fig. S4).
The complemented strains had similar pigmentation to WT during phototrophic growth most likely due to restored production of haem, bacteriochlorophyll and LH1 and LH2 complex proteins similar to that observed in R. palustris CGA009 (Fig. S4) (Rey and Harwood, 2010).
Why only partial restoration of pioABC expression occurred is unclear.



FixK directly binds the FixK I box of the pioABC promoter

To determine whether FixK could directly interact with the identified FixK I and FixK II boxes, we performed gel mobility-shift assays using recombinant FixK protein (Fig. S5 and Fig. 6).
These experiments showed that purified FixK protein was able to bind a double-stranded (ds) DNA substrate that had the FixK I box as well as a dsDNA substrate that had both the FixK I and FixK II box.
However, purified FixK did not bind a dsDNA substrate that had only the FixK II box.
FixK binding was specific as it could be competed out with competitive unlabelled DNA.
In addition, purified FixK was unable to bind a non-cognate, Oct2A (a eukaryotic transcription factor; Corcoran and Shore, 2000) binding site containing dsDNA substrate (provided in the DIG Gel Shift Kit, Second Generation; Roche, Indianapolis, IN).
Overall, these data suggest that FixK binds the pioABC promoter at the FixK I box but not the FixK II box, thereby mediating regulation of this operon.
Although the FixK II box was observed to be important for expression in vivo, it did not bind FixK.
This implies that either it binds other proteins in the CRP/FNR family or can bind FixK only under specific conditions absent in our in vitro assay.
DNA topology of the FixK II box and/or the low binding affinity of FixK protein for this site might also account for this result.



Putative FixK target genes are upregulated during anaerobic phototrophic growth

The R. palustris CGA009 genome was scanned for the presence of potential FixK binding sites in a previous study (Conlan et al., 2005).
Canonical FixK boxes were observed in the promoter regions of 21 ORFs in this organism including pioA.
We therefore identified homologues of these genes in R. palustris TIE-1 and assessed the change in their expression using qRT-PCR.
The fold change in mRNA abundance was calculated with respect to aerobic chemoheterotrophic growth on succinate (Table 1).
This revealed that a number of selected genes are upregulated more than fivefold during phototrophic growth.
These genes encompassed a number of different aspects of the physiology of R. palustris TIE-1 including respiration, photosynthesis, gene regulation and transport.
A detailed description of these genes can be found in the supporting information.
Their upregulation during anaerobic growth suggests that they are likely part of the FixK regulon in R. palustris TIE-1 that allows it to adapt to anoxia as shown recently for R. palustris CGA009 under microoxic conditions (Rey and Harwood, 2010).



FixK affects the expression of a number of predicted target genes

To establish the influence of FixK on expression of the putative target genes, we determined their level of expression in WT R. palustris TIE-1 using qRT-PCR and compared it with deltafixK (Table 2).
Only one gene, encoding a putative potassium uptake protein (kup1), showed more than fivefold increase in expression in deltafixK under anaerobic growth conditions (Schleyer and Bakker, 1993).
Transcripts for this gene were not significantly upregulated during any anaerobic growth condition in the WT (Table 1).
In contrast, expression of 14 of the 20 putative FixK target genes assessed decreased in deltafixK.
hemO, ccoN(OQP) and bchD, all photosynthetic genes, showed a dramatic decrease in deltafixK during phototrophic growth.
The regulatory genes selected were also downregulated more than fivefold on at least one anaerobic growth condition in deltafixK.
Some other interesting genes encoding transport-related functions also emerged as FixK targets such as Rpal_4015 (predicted ORF involved in siderophore biosynthesis), Rpal_4994 (ompW homologue), Rpal_1868 (osmY homologue), Rpal_2582 (first gene of a heavy metal transporting operon) and Rpal_1412 (a signal peptide containing ORF with transmembrane domains).
Two ORFs Rpal_1413 (putative inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase) (Zhang et al., 1999) and Rpal_1691 (hypothetical protein) were also modestly downregulated in deltafixK.
