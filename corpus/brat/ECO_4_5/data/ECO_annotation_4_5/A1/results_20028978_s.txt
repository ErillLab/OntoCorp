Cyclic AMP Binding at Two Independent Sites Enhances CRPMt-DNA Interactions

Whereas E. coli CRP is very responsive to cAMP, exhibiting nonspecific low affinity DNA binding in the absence of cAMP (27), previous reports of the effects of cAMP on the properties of CRPMt have been equivocal.
Rickman et al. (16) and Bai et al. (15) found significant binding of CRPMt to target DNA in the absence of cAMP and only marginal enhancement upon addition of up to 0.1 mm cAMP.
In contrast, Agarwal et al. (17) failed to detect DNA binding in the absence of cAMP, but binding was observed in the presence of 1 mm cAMP.
Others have shown that incubation with cAMP alters intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (41) and the polypeptide profiles obtained when CRPMt is digested with trypsin (15), implying that cAMP causes conformational changes in CRPMt.
To investigate further, we have isolated recombinant His6-tagged CRPMt by overproduction in a cyaA mutant of E. coli, which is unable to synthesize cAMP.
This cAMP-free CRPMt protein was then used to determine the polypeptide profiles obtained after digestion of CRPMt with trypsin in the absence and presence of cAMP (Fig. 1A, lanes 2 - 7).
In contrast to E. coli CRP, which is relatively resistant to trypsin cleavage in the absence of cAMP (42), CRPMt was readily digested by trypsin, yielding a major polypeptide of molecular mass ~16 kDa, as estimated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A).
In the presence of cAMP, the protein was more resistant to proteolysis, and a major polypeptide of molecular mass ~15 kDa was obtained.
In the presence of cGMP, the sensitivity of CRPMt to trypsin was similar to that observed in the absence of cAMP, although a different digestion pattern, which included both major polypeptides (~16 and ~15 kDa) observed in the absence and presence of cAMP, was obtained suggesting that cGMP is bound by CRPMt with concomitant changes in conformation that are different from those invoked by cAMP (Fig. 1A, lanes 10 - 15).
Significantly, addition of cAMP after preincubation with cGMP for 10 min, or vice versa, resulted in a limited proteolysis pattern identical to that obtained with cAMP alone indicating that cAMP is the preferred ligand (Fig. 1A, lanes 20 - 24).
To ensure that the presence of the His6 tag was not influencing the interaction of CRPMt with cAMP, the His6 tag was removed by thrombin cleavage, and the partial proteolysis experiments were repeated.
This showed that untagged CRPMt exhibited the same behavior as the tagged protein in the absence (supplemental Fig. S1, lanes 3 and 6) and presence (supplemental Fig. S1, lanes 4 and 7) of cAMP suggesting that the His6 tag was not affecting the gross conformational changes induced by cAMP binding.
Therefore, the His6-tagged form of CRPMt was considered suitable for further ligand binding studies.

Isothermal calorimetry was used to determine the stoichiometry and affinity of cAMP binding to His6-CRPMt.
A typical titration is shown in Fig. 1B.
The data yield good nonlinear least squares fitting to a single set of identical binding sites model and are consistent with each protomer of the CRPMt dimer binding one cAMP molecule with relatively weak (Kb of ~1.7 x 104m-1) affinity.
Furthermore, the binding of cAMP is an endothermic reaction (DeltaGb -23.7 kJ mol-1) with a positive binding enthalpy (DeltaHb ~ 30.7 kJ mol-1).
Therefore, the entropy change TDeltaSb is ~54.4 kJ mol-1 K-1, and hence cAMP binding is entropically driven.
Chemical cross-linking showed that CRPMt is a dimer (not shown), and thus the data indicate that unlike the E. coli CRP dimer, the two cAMP-binding sites in the CRPMt dimer are independent.

The effect of cAMP binding on the ability of CRPMt to bind DNA in vivo was tested in the heterologous host E. coli because M. tuberculosis has 17 predicted adenylyl cyclase proteins, and E. coli has only one, CyaA; and thus it is possible to simply create a cAMP-free background for these experiments.
The parent E. coli strain was a crp lac double mutant into which a cyaA mutation was introduced.
The readout (beta-galactosidase activity) from the simple CRP-repressed promoter CCgalDelta4, which contains a consensus CRP site that is recognized by CRPMt located such that occupation of this site occludes the promoter (18, 34), was used as a measure of the DNA binding activity of CRPMt as shown previously by Spreadbury et al. (18).
In the CyaA+ and CyaA- strains containing the vector (ptac85), transcription from the reporter was similar (761 +- 24 and 722 +- 25 Miller units, respectively, n = 5).
However, in the presence of the CRPMt expression plasmid (pGS1645), reporter transcription was ~60% lower (323 +- 86 Miller units, n = 5) in the Cya+ strain compared with that observed in the absence of CRPMt, consistent with the observations of Spreadbury et al. (18).
However, in the cyaA mutant, which is unable to synthesize cAMP, the readout from the reporter in the presence of CRPMt increased by ~2-fold (613 +- 20 Miller units, n = 5) compared with the Cya+ strain to reach ~80% of the activity observed in the absence of CRPMt.
These data are consistent with cAMP enhancing DNA binding of CRPMt in vivo.

To investigate the effect of cAMP on CRPMt DNA binding in vitro, preliminary electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to show that CRPMt formed at least two complexes at the whiB1 promoter in the absence and presence of cAMP but that DNA binding was enhanced in the presence of cAMP (supplemental Fig. S2A).
Furthermore, in cAMP titration experiments, CRPMt binding to the whiB1 promoter was enhanced when the cAMP concentration exceeded 0.05 mm (not shown), consistent with the isothermal calorimetry experiments.
Moreover, the presence of the His6 tag did not significantly affect DNA binding by CRPMt in the absence (not shown) and presence of cAMP (supplemental Fig. S2B).
Thus, the His6-tagged form was used in further DNA binding studies.

In summary, the work described above shows the following: (i) that CRPMt binds two cAMP molecules per dimer (one per subunit); (ii) that the cAMP-binding sites act independently; and (iii) that cAMP binding induces conformational changes in the CRPMt dimer that enhance specific DNA binding in vitro and in vivo.



whiB1 Promoter Contains Two CRPMt-binding Sites

The whiB1 gene encodes a Wbl (WhiB-like) protein.
These proteins have iron-sulfur clusters and are found only in actinomycetes (26) where they are thought to function as transcription factors and/or as protein-disulfide reductases.
The whiB1 transcript was less abundant in a CRPMt mutant (16), implying that CRPMt activates whiB1 expression, which was confirmed using a whiB1-lacZ fusion (17).
5'-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was used to confirm that the whiB1 transcript start was located at 109 or 110 bp upstream of the translational start as reported by Agarwal et al. (17) (data not shown).
The electrophoretic mobility shift assays (supplemental Fig. S2A) suggested the presence of more than one CRPMt-binding site in the whiB1 promoter.
Inspection of the whiB1 promoter region indicated the presence of two potential CRPMt-binding sites upstream of the transcript start (Fig. 2).
The first site (CRP1) located at -58.5 relative to the transcript start matches the proposed CRPMt consensus (NGTGNNANNNNNCACA) of Rickman et al. (16) in seven of the eight defined bases (Fig. 2).
The second potential site (CRP2) is a poorer match to the consensus (six of the eight defined bases are matched) and is located at -37.5 relative to the transcript start.
The CRP1 site has previously been implicated in CRPMt-dependent activation of whiB1 expression (17).

DNase I footprinting showed that both CRP1 and CRP2 sites in the whiB1 promoter were recognized by CRPMt and that binding to both sites was enhanced in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 3A).
Titration of the whiB1 promoter with increasing concentrations of CRPMt showed that the CRP1 site (-70 to -51) was occupied before the CRP2 site (-50 to -29) (Fig. 3A).
Furthermore, mutation of CRP1 (indicated by lowercase letters, AGTGAGATAGCCCACG to AGTtAGATAGCCaACG) or CRP2 (CGTAACACTATTGACA to CcaAACACTATTGACA) inhibited binding of CRPMt to these sites (Fig. 3B).
Inactivation of CRP1 also impaired, but did not abolish, binding to CRP2 (Fig. 3B, compare lane 5 with 6).
Thus, it was concluded: (i) the whiB1 promoter possesses tandem CRPMt sites, (ii) binding to these sites is enhanced in the presence of cAMP; and (iii) occupation of CRP2 is improved by occupation of CRP1.



Both CRPMt-binding Sites in the whiB1 Promoter Are Functional

The DNase I footprinting studies indicated that there are two CRPMt sites in the whiB1 promoter.
The functionality of the sites was tested by in vitro transcription experiments.
Transcription from the whiB1 promoter in the presence of M. smegmatis RNAP was low (Fig. 4A, lane 3).
At low concentrations of CRPMt, whiB1 transcription was enhanced, but at higher concentrations CRPMt inhibited transcription (Fig. 4A, lanes 4 - 8).
This same pattern of regulation was observed with the untagged form of CRPMt (supplemental Fig. S3, compare lanes 3 - 6 and lanes 7 - 10), indicating that the presence of the His6 tag does not alter the transcriptional behavior of CRPMt.
A similar transcription profile was observed in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 4A, lanes 9 - 16) except for the following: (i) there was a reproducible decrease in basal transcription (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3 and 11), and (ii) the response curve was shifted to the left, with maximum whiB1 expression occurring in the presence of 1.3 mum CRPMt in the presence of cAMP compared with 2.5 mum CRPMt in the absence of cAMP (Fig. 4B).
This result is consistent with cAMP enhancing CRPMt binding to both CRP1 and CRP2 sites in the whiB1 promoter.
In conjunction with the footprinting experiments described above, these data were interpreted to mean that binding to the high affinity CRP1 site activates whiB1 transcription, whereas occupation of both CRP1 and CRP2 sites inhibits whiB1 transcription.
This conclusion was supported by in vitro transcription reactions with whiB1 promoters carrying mutations in CRP1 and/or CRP2 (Fig. 4C).
At a low CRPMt concentration (2.5 mum) in the absence of cAMP, the footprinting evidence indicates that CRP1 will be occupied at the wild-type promoter.
Under these conditions, mutation of the CRP1 site decreased transcription of whiB1 (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 1 and 2).
Under the same conditions, mutation of CRP2 slightly enhanced whiB1 transcription (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 1 and 3).
A similar pattern was observed in the presence of cAMP (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 5 - 7).
At a higher CRPMt concentration (20 mum), the footprints indicate that both CRP1 and CRP2 will be occupied.
Under these conditions, impairment of CRP1 had little effect on transcription compared with the wild-type promoter, i.e. transcription remained low (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 9 and 10 and lanes 13 and 14).
However, impairment of CRP2 enhanced transcription of whiB1 compared with the wild-type promoter under these conditions (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 9 and 11, and lanes 13 and 15).
Hence, these observations suggest that occupation of CRP2 is sufficient to repress basal transcription from PwhiB1.
In the presence of cAMP, mutation of both CRPMt sites resulted in transcription similar to that of the unaltered promoter in the absence of CRPMt (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 8 and 16).
In the absence of cAMP, transcription from the whiB1 promoter with both CRP1 and CRP2 impaired was lower than from the unaltered promoter in the absence of CRPMt, suggesting that in the absence of cAMP there is still some unproductive interaction between CRPMt and the altered whiB1 promoter despite the impairment of both CRP-binding sites (Fig. 4, C and D, lanes 4 and 12).
Note that transcription in the absence of CRPMt for all the altered promoters was the same as that for the unaltered whiB1 promoter, indicating that the changes to the sequences of the CRP sites had not affected the basal level of transcription (data not shown).

The in vitro transcription experiments showed that CRPMt acts as both an activator (at low concentrations) and repressor (at high concentrations) of whiB1 expression.
Permanganate footprinting to detect open complex formation showed the presence of quantitatively similar distortions of DNA at nucleotide T -8 in the whiB1 promoter mediated by RNAP in the presence or absence of 2.5 mum CRPMt (Fig. 5A, lanes 3, 4, 8, and 9).
This evidence suggests that CRPMt-mediated activation of whiB1 expression probably occurs after open complex formation, because in the absence of CRPMt transcription from the whiB1 promoter is low (Fig. 4A, compare lanes 3 and 4).
In the presence of 20 mum CRPMt, the open complex was not detected (Fig. 5A, lanes 5 and 10) indicating that higher concentrations of CRPMt inhibit whiB1 expression at a point before open complex formation, probably by inhibiting RNAP binding.

DNase I footprinting of the whiB1 promoter in the presence of M. smegmatis RNAP and activating concentrations of CRPMt (2.5 mum) showed that RNAP could bind at the promoter when the CRP1 site was occupied and that this was accompanied by the appearance of an RNAP-dependent hypersensitive site at position -34, which is within the CRP2 site (Fig. 5B).
The presence of the hypersensitive site is attributed to docking of the C-terminal domain of the RNAP alpha-subunit downstream of CRPMt bound at CRP1.

To determine whether the effects of CRPMt on whiB1 transcription observed in vitro were also apparent in vivo, a promoter fusion containing DNA from -187 to 129 relative to the transcript start was fused upstream of a lac reporter gene, and transcription was estimated in M. tuberculosis wild-type H37Rv and an isogenic Rv3676 (crp) mutant (Fig. 6).
Under exponential growth conditions, expression of whiB1 was decreased by ~3-fold in the CRPMt mutant (DeltaRv3676), consistent with CRPMt-dependent activation.
An ~5-fold reduction in expression was observed when the CRP1 site was disabled, reflecting the absence of activation from CRP1 but retention of repression from CRP2.
Accordingly, mutation of CRP2, without disrupting the -35 element (underlined) of the whiB1 promoter (CGTAACACTATTGACA to CcaAACACTATTGACA), resulted in a small but reproducible increase in whiB1 expression.
Similarly, improvement of the CRP2 site (CGTAACACTATTGACA to CGTgACACTATTGACA) caused a reproducible decrease in whiB1 expression.
Disabling both CRP1 and CRP2 lowered beta-galactosidase activities by an amount similar to that observed using the unaltered promoter in the crp mutant.
The in vivo data correlated well with the in vitro transcription data as shown in Fig. 4, C and D. Thus, when 2.5 mum CRPMt was used in the in vitro transcription reactions (Fig. 4D), the fold changes in transcription upon impairment of CRP-binding sites compared with the unaltered promoter were as follows: -3.5 to -2.4 when CRP1 was impaired; +1.2 to +1.6 when CRP2 was impaired; and -2.6 to -2.0 when both CRP1 and CRP2 were impaired.
These values are similar to those obtained for transcription in vivo (Fig. 6) as follows: -4.6 when CRP1 was impaired; +1.2 when CRP2 was impaired; and -2.0 when CRP1 and CRP2 were impaired.
Hence, the in vitro and in vivo experiments are consistent with a mechanism in which occupation of CRP1 enhances whiB1 expression, whereas occupation of both CRP1 and CRP2 or of CRP2 alone represses whiB1 expression in M. tuberculosis.
