IscR activates K. pneumoniae CPS biosynthesis in an Fe-S cluster-dependent manner

To study whether IscR regulates K. pneumoniae CPS biosynthesis, we determined the amounts of K2 CPS in CG43S3 (wild type [WT]) and AP001 (DeltaiscR) strains.
Compared with the WT, AP001 produced significantly lower amounts of CPS (Fig. 1A), suggesting that IscR activates the biosynthesis of CPS.
In K. pneumoniae, IscR contains three highly conserved cysteine residues (C92, C98, and C104 in E. coli IscR) which are thought to coordinate the [2Fe-2S] cluster [20].

To investigate the role of the [2Fe-2S] cluster in IscR regulation of CPS biosynthesis, we created an iscR mutant AP002 (iscR3CA) by replacing the three cysteines with alanines and tested whether this mutant, which is predicted to encode an IscR lacking an Fe-S cluster, affected CPS biosynthesis.
As shown in Fig. 1A, we found that the amount of CPS decreased in the AP002 strain compared with that in the WT, indicating that the regulation of IscR required the [2Fe-2S] cluster.
Moreover, iscR and iscR3CA were respectively cloned into pACYC184, to yield pIscR and pIscR3CA, for complementation analysis.
Compared with AP001 [pACYC184], AP001 [pIscR] produced a significantly higher amount of CPS, whereas the introduction of pIscR3CA into the AP001 strain did not change the CPS amount (Fig. 1B).
These results confirmed that IscR has a positive role in the regulation of CPS biosynthesis and that the presence of the [2Fe-2S] cluster of IscR is essential for this regulation.
On the other hand, the CPS amount appeared to obviously increased in AP001 [pIscR], compared with that in WT [pACYC184] (Fig. 1B), which may result from multicopy plasmids are used for complementation.
Therefore, we also used single copy constructs to complement the iscR-deletion (Methods S1), and the result showed that the expression of iscR, but not iscR3CA, could restore the CPS biosynthesis (Fig. S1).

The K2 cps gene cluster of K. pneumoniae contains 19 open reading frames (ORFs) organised into 3 transcription units - namely, orf1 - 2, orf3 - 15, and orf16 - 17[22].
To determine the role of IscR in regulating cps transcription, we used the reporter plasmids pOrf12 (Porf1-2::lacZ), pOrf315 (Porf3-15::lacZ), and pOrf1617 (Porf16-17::lacZ), each carrying a promoterless lacZ gene transcriptionally fused to the putative promoter region of the K2 cps gene cluster [23], to transform the K. pneumoniae strains AP006 (DeltalacZ), AP007 (DeltalacZ-DeltaiscR), and AP008 (DeltalacZ-iscR3CA).
The measurements shown in Fig. 1C reveal that the promoter activity of orf1 - 2 and orf16 - 17 in AP007 and AP008 was lower than that in AP006 (P<0.01).
Additionally, the promoter activity of orf3 - 15 was apparently decreased in AP008 but slightly decreased in AP007 compared with that in AP006.
These results indicated that IscR activates the transcription of cps genes in an Fe-S cluster-dependent manner.



IscR directly binds the promoter of galF

For further investigation of the mechanism of IscR regulation on cps transcription, the sequence of the putative IscR binding site was manually analysed in the three promoter regions of the K2 cps gene cluster.
As shown in Fig. 2A, we found a putative type 1 IscR box with 52% (13/25 bp) homology to the consensus sequence located between -173 bp and -197 bp relative to the translational start codon of galF (orf1 in the K2 cps gene cluster).
In addition, the putative IscR binding sequence in PgalF was highly homologous to the IscR-binding motif (5'-AxxxCCxxAxxxxxxxTAxGGxxxT-3') reported by Nesbit et al. [21].
However, no typical IscR binding site was found in the upstream sequence of wzi (orf3 in the K2 cps gene cluster) or manC (orf16 in the K2 cps gene cluster), suggesting that IscR indirectly regulates the promoter activities of orf3-15 and orf16-17, which remains to be studied.
On the other hand, we hypothesised that IscR binds directly to the promoter region of galF to activate gene transcription, and we confirmed this by performing an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2B, purified recombinant IscR::His6 protein was able to bind PgalF-1 but not PgalF-2, in which the region containing the putative IscR binding site was deleted.
In addition, compared with that of IscR::His6, the recombinant [2Fe-2S] clusterless IscR3CA::His6 had reduced PgalF-1 binding activity.
Furthermore, no obvious interaction between the recombinant IscR proteins and PgalF-1*, the galF promoter lacking only the 25-bp predicted IscR box, was found (the lower panel of Fig. 2B).
Besides, PgalF-1 and PgalF-1* DNA showed a slightly different mobility in the gel.
These results suggested a direct interaction between IscR and the galF promoter and that the [2Fe-2S] cluster of IscR plays a crucial role in this interaction.
On the contrary, we also analysed whether recombinant IscR::His6 could bind the promoter regions of wzi and manC.
As expected, EMSA showed no obvious DNA-protein complex (data not shown).



Effect of IscR on normal human serum resistance

Because CPS acts as a protectant for K. pneumoniae against serum factors, we hypothesize that through modulation of CPS levels, IscR affects the ability of K. pneumoniae to resist the bactericidal effects of serum.
To test this hypothesis, we treated K. pneumoniae strains with 75% normal human serum and determined their survival rates.
Compared with the WT, the AP001 and AP002 strains had a slightly reduced survival rate (Fig. 3A), implying a positive role for [2Fe-2S]-IscR in the serum resistance of K. pneumoniae.
To confirm this result further, we performed a complementation study.
As shown in Fig. 3B, the introduction of pIscR, but not pACYC184 or pIscR3CA, into the AP001 strain increased the bacterial survival rate, to a similar level compared with that of WT [pACYC184], after serum treatment.
These results supported the hypothesis that [2Fe-2S]-IscR activates the expression of CPS to increase K. pneumoniae resistance to normal human serum.



IscR has a regulatory role in iron acquisition systems

In E. coli, both Fur and IscR play important roles in the maintenance of cellular iron homeostasis [12], [13].
To analyse whether IscR regulates iron acquisition in K. pneumoniae, we performed a chrome azurol S (CAS) assay to assess siderophore secretion in K. pneumoniae strains.
As shown in Fig. 4A, no apparent siderophore secretion was detected in the WT, AP001, or AP002 strains.
Moreover, as in our previous report [10], deletion of fur clearly increased halo formation on the CAS plate.
However, the halo was reduced in the AP003 (Deltafur) strain background by the further deletion of iscR, indicating the positive role of IscR in iron acquisition.
Furthermore, no obvious difference in siderophore secretion was found between the AP003 and AP005 (Deltafur- iscR3CA) strains, suggesting that the IscR regulation of iron acquisition does not require the [2Fe-2S] cluster.

To verify whether apo-IscR activates iron acquisition, we introduced pACYC184, pIscR, or pIscR3CA into the AP004 (Deltafur-DeltaiscR) strain and performed a CAS assay.
As shown in Fig. 4B, the introduction of both pIscR and pIscR3CA increased the halo phenotype on the CAS plate compared with that of the vector-only control.
These results confirmed that IscR activates siderophore secretion in a [2Fe-2S] cluster-independent manner.

To further investigate the regulatory effect of IscR on iron acquisition, we used quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to measure the expression of genes corresponding to the eight putative iron acquisition systems in the indicated K. pneumoniae strains.
As shown in Table 1, messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of genes (fhuA, iucA, and sitA) corresponding to three iron acquisition systems were increased more than 2-fold in the AP005 strain as compared with that in the AP004 strain.
To further confirm this result, pACYC184, pIscR3CA, or pIscR were respectively introduced into the AP004 strain, to avoid the effects of Fur, and the transcription of fhuA, iucA, and sitA were measured.
The introduction of pIscR3CA into AP004 apparently increased the transcription of fhuA, iucA, and sitA compared with that in the AP004 strain carrying pACYC184 only (Table 1).
These results implied that apo-IscR activates the transcription of fhu, iuc, and sit to increase iron acquisition in K. pneumoniae.
Besides, the introduction of pIscR into AP004 also slightly increased transcription of fhu, iuc, and sit (Table 1).



IscR3CA directly binds the promoter region of fhuA, iucA, and sitA

Apo-IscR has been demonstrated to bind the type 2 IscR box in IscR-regulated promoter sequences directly in E. coli[19].
Analysis of the promoter regions of fhuA, iucA, and sitA revealed consensus sequences of the E. coli type 2 IscR box.
As shown in Fig. 5A, the predicted type 2 IscR boxes are located at -154 to -130 relative to the translation start site of fhuA and -67 to -43 relative to the translation start site of iucA.
The predicted type 2 IscR boxes in PfhuA and PiucA have 50% (13/26 bp) and 46% (12/26 bp) homology, respectively, with the consensus sequence.
In addition, two putative type 2 IscR boxes (R1 and R2) located at -112 to -87 and at -53 to -28 relative to the translation start site of sitA were found in PsitA.
The R1 and R2 sites contain 50% (13/26 bp) and 61.5% (16/26 bp) homology, respectively, with the consensus sequence.

To verify whether apo-IscR binds to these predicted type 2 IscR boxes, we performed an EMSA.
As shown in Fig. 5B - D, both the purified IscR::His6 and IscR3CA::His6 were able to bind with the promoter regions of fhuA, iucA, and sitA, and IscR::His6 appeared to contain higher binding activities.
Furthermore, IscR3CA::His6 did not bind PfhuA-2 and PiucA-2, which lacked a region containing a putative IscR box (Fig. 6B - C).
We also found that IscR3CA::His6 did not bind PiucA-2, which contained the R1 site but not the R2 site (Fig. 6D).
To further confirm the importance of these predicted IscR boxes, recombinant IscR proteins were respectively interacted with these promoters lacking only the 26-bp predicted type 2 IscR box (PfhuA-1*, PiucA-1*, and PiucA-1*), and no obvious interaction was found.
These results suggested that apo-IscR interacts directly with the promoters of fhuA, iucA, and sitA via the predicted type 2 IscR boxes.



Regulatory control of iscR transcription in K. pneumoniae

To analyse whether environmental iron availability affects K. pneumoniae iscR expression, we grew AP006 in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with increasing amounts of the iron chelator 2, 2-dipyridyl (Dip) and monitored the promoter activity of iscR using a LacZ reporter system [23].
As shown in Fig. 6A, the addition of 250 or 500 microM Dip to the growth medium increased iscR promoter (PiscR) activity by approximately 2-fold and 3.9-fold, respectively, indicating that the transcription of the iscRSUA operon was activated by iron limitation.

In K. pneumoniae, Fur and RyhB reportedly play crucial roles in gene regulation in response to cellular iron levels [10], [11].
Thus, we investigated whether Fur and RyhB regulate the activity of PiscR.
As shown in Fig. 6B, the deletion of fur and the further deletion of ryhB in AP006 strain had no obvious effects on PiscR activity, whereas the deletion of iscR in AP006 strain activated PiscR activity by approximately 4.5-fold.
In E. coli, IscR has been demonstrated to exert negative auto-regulation which requires the [2Fe-2S] cluster [20].
Thus, we measured PiscR activity in an AP006-derived strain, AP008 (DeltalacZ-iscR3CA), expressing a mutated IscR predicted to be defective in cluster binding [20].
As shown in Fig. 6B, the PiscR activity in AP008 was increased approximately 4.5-fold.
This increase was comparable to that in AP007 (DeltalacZ-DeltaiscR).
Our results suggested that IscR inhibits the transcription of the iscRSUA operon in a [2Fe-2S] cluster-dependent manner in K. pneumoniae.

To investigate whether IscR is the sole regulator of iscRSUA transcription in response to iron availability, we monitored PiscR activity in the AP007 and AP008 strains in LB broth containing various levels of iron.
As shown in Fig. 6C, the PiscR activity in AP006 was activated in LB broth supplemented with Dip, and the further addition of 100 or 250 microM FeSO4 reversed the activation.
In the AP007 and AP008 strains, PiscR activity was increased compared with that of AP006.
Nevertheless, the addition of Dip still activated PiscR activity, suggesting the presence of unknown factors, and the further addition of FeSO4 restored the effect.

To analyse whether Fur is responsible for this regulation, we measured PiscR activity in AP011 (DeltalacZ-Deltafur-DeltaiscR) compared with that of AP007 at various iron levels and noted no obvious effect.
These results indicated that in addition to IscR and Fur, other factors modulate the transcription of the iscRSUA operon in response to environmental iron availability.
