LexA targets a novel LexA-binding motif in the Verrucomicrobia

The presence of core SOS response operons (lexA [VSP_RS04780], recA [VSP_RS32310], and imuA-imuB-dnaE2 [VSP_RS05590-VSP_RS05595-VSP_RS05600]) in the genome of the representative Verrucomicrobia species V. spinosum DSM 4136 indicates that this phylum might possess a functional LexA regulatory network.
However, computational searches using known LexA-binding motifs did not yield putative LexA-binding sites upstream of any SOS related genes in V. spinosum.
Taking advantage of the availability of multiple genome and metagenome assemblies for the Verrucomicrobia phylum, we compiled 116 promoter sequences from 59 different assemblies corresponding to orthologs of the V. spinosum DSM 4136 lexA, recA, and imuA genes through the JGI-IMG service (Supplementary Material 2).
We then used MEME to identify overrepresented motifs in these sequences.
The most significant motif identified by MEME (Figure 1A) is a 14 bp palindromic motif with consensus sequence (TGTTC-N4-GAACA).
This motif was identified in the promoter region of 27 lexA genes, 25 recA genes, and 3 imuA genes, corresponding to 36 different genome and metagenome assemblies and spanning all three major groups of Verrucomicrobia (Supplementary Material 3).
A computational search also identified instances of this motif in the promoter sequences of the V. spinosum DSM 4136 lexA, recA, and imuA-imuB-dnaE2 operons (Figure 1B).
The TGTTC-N4-GAACA motif is reminiscent of the LexA-binding motif (GAAC-N4-GTTC) previously reported in the Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Gallionellales (Davis et al., 2002; Au et al., 2005; Sanchez-Alberola et al., 2015).
Together with its structural similarity to previously reported LexA-binding motifs, the presence of this motif in the promoter region of multiple orthologs for three core components of the SOS response strongly suggested that the identified TGTTC-N4-GAACA motif is the LexA-binding motif of the Verrucomicrobia.

To validate that the palindromic motif identified in silico was the LexA-binding motif of V. spinosum, we purified the V. spinosum DSM 4136 LexA protein [WP_009959117] and performed electro-mobility shift assays (EMSA) with wild-type and mutant versions of the V. spinosum DSM 4136 recA promoter containing single-nucleotide substitutions at each position of the predicted LexA-binding motif.
The results of this site-directed mutagenesis analysis (Figure 1C) are in broad agreement with the motif predicted in silico, confirming that V. spinosum LexA targets a spaced dyad motif with consensus sequence TGTTC-N4-GAACA.
Single-nucleotide mutations to the bases of the inverted repeat regions (TGTTC and GAACA) of the V. spinosum LexA-binding motif systematically abolish LexA binding in the recA promoter context, indicating that these conserved elements likely correspond to the monomer binding site and are therefore essential for LexA binding activity (Groban et al., 2005).
In contrast, the 4 bp spacer region and 3 bp flanking regions tolerate single-nucleotide mutations, suggesting that they are predominantly involved in indirect readout and DNA bending (Zhang et al., 2010).

Previous work has established that the alpha3 helix of the N-terminal helix-turn-helix motif is responsible for the majority of the specific contacts with monomer binding sites of LexA-binding motifs (Oertel-Buchheit et al., 1990; Ottleben et al., 1991; Thliveris and Mount, 1992; Groban et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2010).
Comparison of the alpha3 helix sequence in Verrucomicrobia LexA proteins with previously reported LexA alpha3 helix motifs (Sanchez-Alberola et al., 2015) shows that the Verrucomicrobia LexA alpha3 helix is most closely related to those of the Betaproteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria.
As shown in Figure 2, the majority of the changes observed in the alpha3 helix of Verrucomicrobia localize to the N-terminal part of the helix, affecting residues that change sequence specificity through direct readout, but that are not essential for DNA bending and structural motif recognition (Oertel-Buchheit et al., 1990; Thliveris et al., 1991; Thliveris and Mount, 1992; Groban et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2010).
Furthermore, the overall distribution of hydrogen donors and hydrophobic residues is preserved across the entire alpha3 helix (Supplementary Material 4).
These observations suggest that the structural similarities between Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motifs are the result of an evolutionary process in the LexA DNA-binding motif that has modified the specific readout of monomer sites without altering the recognition of the overall motif structure.



The Verrucomicrobia LexA protein targets tandem binding sites in LexA promoters

Close inspection of the V. spinosum lexA promoter reveals a poorly conserved LexA-binding site immediately downstream (1 bp) of the putative LexA-binding site identified in silico (Figure 3).
To confirm that both these putative motif instances are involved in LexA binding, we performed EMSA with purified V. spinosum LexA protein on the lexA promoter.
The results shown in Figure 4A revealed the distinct formation of two retardation bands on the lexA promoter at low protein concentrations, corresponding to LexA binding at either one or the two LexA-binding sites identified in the lexA promoter.
Further, increasing protein concentration resulted in a single retardation band corresponding to LexA recognizing both LexA-binding sites.
Taken together, these results indicate that the two identified LexA-binding sites in the promoter region of the V. spinosum lexA gene are bound cooperatively by LexA.
A systematic analysis of the promoter regions of V. spinosum lexA gene orthologs in the Verrucomicrobia revealed that more than half of the lexA ortholog promoters with predicted LexA-binding sites display similar tandem site configurations (Supplementary Material 5).
Most of these tandem arrangements involve a conserved TGTTC-N4-GAACA motif instance followed by a degenerate site in which only the first TGTTC element is conserved, but a tandem site arrangement with both conserved sites can be observed in at least two species (Figure 3).

In Opitutus terrae PB90-1, there are two fully conserved Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motifs in the promoter region of a putative lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 operon [OTER_RS20480-OTER_RS20475-OTER_RS20470-OTER_RS20465] separated by 2 bp.
This arrangement generates an instance of the canonical GAAC-N4-GTTC LexA-binding motif of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria.
Using purified O. terrae and B. subtilis LexA proteins, we performed EMSA to validate the functionality of this tandem arrangement in O. terrae (Figure 4).
EMSA with O. terrae LexA [WP_012376858] reveals two retardation bands at low protein concentration, confirming that this protein also binds to both Verrucomicrobia LexA target sites in the lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 promoter (Figure 4B).
Mobility assays with incremental concentrations of B. subtilis LexA [WP_003238209] show that B. subtilis LexA binds a unique element in the O. terrae lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 promoter, yielding a single retardation band similar to the one observed on the B. subtilis recA [BSU16940] promoter (Figure 4C).
These results suggest that B. subtilis LexA binds the Firmicutes-like LexA-binding motif instance generated by the tandem arrangement of Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding sites.



The core Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon comprises three operons involved in DNA repair and mutagenesis

Having established the LexA-binding motif of the Verrucomicrobia, we performed a comparative genomics analysis of the LexA regulon in this phylum.
We compiled 15 whole-genome shotgun assemblies for members of all the major classes of Verrucomicrobia (Opitutae, Spartobacteria, and Verrucomicrobiae) presenting a V. spinosum LexA homolog and searched for putative LexA-binding sites in the promoter region [-250, +50] of predicted operons.
The results of the comparative genomics analysis (Figure 5; Supplementary Materials 6, 7) reveal a core LexA regulon present in all classes of the Verrucromicrobia phylum and composed of three operons: lexA, splB, and imuA-imuB-dnaE2.
The lexA gene displays high-scoring sites in all the analyzed species, except for Verrucomicrobium sp. 3C (TaxID: 1134055), Verrucomicrobia bacterium LP2A (TaxID: 478741), and Pedosphaera parvula Ellin514 (TaxID: 320771).
The LexA proteins of these species display significant changes to the alpha3 helix of the LexA DNA-binding domain, suggesting that they may target a divergent LexA-binding motif.
Consistent with this result, the genomes of these organisms do not reveal any instance of the Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motif in the promoter regions of previously documented SOS genes (Erill et al., 2007).
The promoter region of the splB gene shows evidence of LexA regulation in several Verrucomicrobiae, one Opitutaceae (O. terrae) and the only available assembly of a Spartobacteria species (Chthoniobacter flavus Ellin428; TaxID: 497964).
The product of the splB gene contains a radical SAM domain (PFAM04055) and has homology to COG1533 (ENOG4105DCH), classified as a DNA repair photolyase.
Members of this orthologous group have been reported to be regulated by LexA in the Actinobacteria, the Gammaproteobacteria, the Betaproteobacteria, and the Alphaproteobacteria (Davis et al., 2002; Cirz et al., 2006; Sanchez-Alberola et al., 2012, 2015; Ulrich et al., 2013), suggesting that it may be a previously unrecognized core component of the SOS response.
Lastly, the promoter region of the imuA-imuB-dnaE2 operon presents Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motif instances in C. flavus and the same Verrucomicrobiae species as splB.
As noted above, O. terrae presents a putative lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 with verified O. terrae LexA binding in its promoter region (Figure 4).
Even though the intergenic distance between lexA and imuA is larger than the genomic average for this species (264 bp), the prevalence of lexA-imuA-imuB-dnaE2 arrangements across the Bacteria domain suggests that this direction constitutes a functional operon in O. terrae (Erill et al., 2006).



The Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon is highly variable and incorporates novel functions

The results of the comparative genomics analysis reveal remarkable variation in the size and composition of the inferred LexA regulon.
In the Verrucomicrobiae, the predicted regulon ranges from one operon (Verrucomicrobia bacterium IMCC26134; TaxID: 1637999) to over 14 (V. spinosum), with several species displaying intermediate sizes [2 operons in Rubritalea marina DSM 17716 (TaxID: 1123070) or 5 in Haloferula sp. BvORR071 (TaxID: 1396141)].
The only available Spartobacteria representative (C. flavus) shows a moderate regulon size (5 operons).
In contrast, the LexA regulon appears to have shrunk noticeably in the Opitutaceae, where it encompasses at the most two operons.
Two members of this family [O. terrae and Opitutaceae bacterium TAV5 (TaxID: 794903)] present a duplication of the lexA gene.
The products of the two Opitutaceae TAV5 lexA genes (OPIT5_RS22040 and OPIT5_RS25725) present 91% identity and their promoter regions contain almost identical LexA-binding sites.
The lexA genes in O. terrae (OTER_RS20480 and OTER_RS11645) have diverged substantially (42% protein sequence identity) and only the promoter of the lexA1 gene (OTER_RS20480) presents Verrucomicrobia LexA-binding motif instances, following the tandem arrangement discussed above (Figure 3).

The overall composition of the inferred Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon is in broad agreement with experimental and computational descriptions of the SOS regulatory network in other phyla (Erill et al., 2007; Sanchez-Alberola et al., 2012, 2015).
Beyond the core regulon described above (lexA, splB, imuA-imuB-dnaE2), the Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon encompasses genes coding for the recombination protein RecA (COG0468; ENOG4105C68), the excinuclease ABC subunits A (COG0178; ENOG411DGUH) and B (COG0556; ENOG4105CCW), two DNA helicase RecQ homologs (COG0514; ENOG4107QS5 and ENOG410QKP1) and two homologs of the error-prone DNA polymerase IV (COG0389; ENOG4105CCW and ENOG4105CQ3).
In addition to these previously established SOS genes, the Verrucomicrobia LexA regulon shows evidence of regulation for an operon encoding proteins matching the TIGR03916 (ENOG4105ES7) and TIGR03915 (ENOG4105T12) models.
These models are present in about 20% of sequenced bacterial genomes, arranged always in operon configuration, and are thought to constitute a DNA base excision repair system involving a uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) domain that is conserved in all Verrucomicrobia TIGR03915-matching homologs.

To validate the predictions of the comparative genomics approach and further establish the LexA regulon of the Verrucomicrobia, we performed EMSA with purified V. spinosum and O. terrae proteins on the promoter region of several genes with predicted LexA-binding sites in these organisms and evidence of regulation in at least three different genomes.
The results, shown in Figure 6, confirm that LexA binds to the promoter region of the splB gene in O. terrae (OTER_RS07185) and V. spinosum (VSP_RS12190).
V. spinosum LexA also binds the imuA-imuB-dnaE2 operon promoter, the promoters of genes coding for DNA polymerase IV (VSP_RS08510) and RecQ (VSP_RS32195) homologs, and the recA (VSP_RS04780) and uvrA (VSP_RS32650) promoters.
Together with the comparative genomics analysis, these results confirm the existence of a conserved core LexA-regulon in the Verrucomicrobia and demonstrate that, in some Verrucomicrobia species, LexA controls a network of similar size and function to those reported in well-studied bacterial phyla, using a novel LexA-binding motif.
