Construction of a mce3R mutant in M. tuberculosis

As a first step to assess the mce3 operon expression in the absence of Mce3R, we obtained a knockout mutant strain of M. tuberculosis H37Rv by inserting a hygromycin cassette into the mce3R gene.
The site-directed mutant strain of M. tuberculosis was obtained by two-step mutagenesis strategy by using the p2NIL shuttle plasmid [21], which carries the lacZ gene and the counter selectable marker sacB.
Allelic exchange was confirmed in the selected clones (HyR, KmS, and SacR) by Southern blotting (Fig. 1A), since the mutant showed a hybridizing fragment of about 1.5 kb absent in the wild-type strain.
This polymorphism is due to the introduction of an extra EcoRI site present in the hygromycin cassette (Fig. 1B).
The mutant strain was designated Deltamce3R.
The mutation was complemented by transforming the plasmid pSummce3R into the mutant.



In vitro characterization of Deltamce3R

To determine whether mce3R disruption introduces alterations during in vitro growth, growth curves of the Deltamce3R mutant, complemented, and parental strains were compared under standard culture conditions.
All assayed strains showed similar doubling time and growth characteristics throughout the culture period (Fig. 2).
This result indicates that the mutation does not affect the in vitro growth of M. tuberculosis.



mce3 operon expression is repressed by Mce3R during in vitro culture and inside murine macrophages

We have previously demonstrated that the mce3 promoter allows the expression of the lacZ reporter gene in M. tuberculosis H37Rv but that this expression is completely abolished when Mce3R is overexpressed in the H37Rv strain from a multi-copy plasmid [13].
Although these findings constitute initial evidence demonstrating the role of Mce3R as a repressor of the mce3 operon transcription, the presence of an endogenous copy of the mce3R gene in M. tuberculosis did not enable us to determine the conditions in which the regulator system operates.

Here, in order to compare the expression the mce3 operon either in the absence or in the presence of Mce3R, DNA fusions of the mce3 promoter to lacZ reporter, containing or not containing mce3R were cloned within pYUB178-lacZ.
The resulting plasmids, pP3-mce3R and pP3 respectively, were integrated into the chromosome of the Deltamce3R strain.
The beta-galactosidase activity was measured at different points along cultures of M. tuberculosis grown in vitro and in a macrophages cell line.
Since transcription of mce3 genes has previously shown to be increased when M. tuberculosis was grown in rich media [10-12] the expression of mce3 operon was assessed in both synthetic (7H9) and rich (Dubos) media (Figure 3 and data not shown).

While hardly any beta-galactosidase activity was detected either in in vitro cultures (Fig. 3) or in cell-line mice macrophages (Table 1) in the presence of Mce3R (Deltamce3R::pP3-mce3R strain), the activity in the Deltamce3R::pP3 strain was remarkably high in all of the conditions tested.
The promoter activity increased along the in vitro cultures of Deltamce3R:: pP3, and peaked at 24 h of infection inside the cell.
These results clearly indicate that Mce3R represses the expression of mce3 operon in M. tuberculosis in the growth conditions tested.



Assessment of the role of Mce3R in the transcription of the four mce operons

A number of reports indicate that the expression of all mce genes depends on the growth conditions [10-12].
These observations, together with the findings that regulatory proteins are involved in the expression of the mce1 and mce3 operons, suggested the idea of a broader regulatory mechanism differentially controlling the expression of mce genes.
In order to test whether Mce3R is able to control the transcription of the other mce operons apart from mce3, the expression of one gene from each mce operon in the mutant strain was compared with that of the wild type.
Primers were designed to amplify a 189, 168, 234, 151 and 134 bp region on mce1D (Rv0172), mce2A (Rv0589), mce3E (Rv1970), mce4A (Rv3499), and sigA respectively.
Amplicons of expected size were obtained with each pair of primers (data not shown).

Differences in relative gene expression between the wild type and the mutant strains were assessed in group means for statistical significance by a randomisation test (see Materials and Methods).
While the relative abundance of mce3E mRNA was significantly higher (P < 0.030) in the mutant than in the wild type strain in the conditions evaluated, no significant differences between both strains were observed on the expression of mce1D (P < 0.74), mce2A (P < 0.918) and mce4A (P < 0.511) (Fig 4).

To verify that RNA samples were not contaminated with genomic DNA, RT-PCR reactions were performed without the addition of reverse transcriptase.
The lack of amplification products verifies that the RT-PCR products were amplified from RNA that had been reversely transcribed into cDNA.

These results demonstrate that Mce3R regulates exclusively the transcription of mce3 operon among mce genes in the conditions tested



Mce3R expression is self regulated

To investigate whether mce3R is subject to transcriptional autoregulation, a transcriptional fusion was constructed between the mce3R promoter and the lacZ reporter.
Since mce3R is located adjacent to mce3 operon and divergently oriented, the mce3R promoter is situated in mce3R-yrbE3A intergenic region.
The entire intergenic region was fused to the lacZ gene within pYUB178-lacZ to create plasmid pPR3-lacZ.
The pPR3-lacZ plasmid was transformed into the wild type M. tuberculosis H37Rv and the M. tuberculosis Deltamce3R mutant, and beta-galactosidase activity was measured to assess the levels of mce3R promoter activity with and without Mce3R regulator.
As shown in figure 5, in the presence of Mce3R (wild type H37Rv strain) the activity of mce3R promoter is steadily and significantly reduced as compared with that in the absence of the Mce3R regulator (mutant Deltamce3R strain).
This reduction in mce3R promoter activity was more evident during the stationary growth phase.
These experiments demonstrate that the Mce3R protein is able to transcriptionally repress expression of the mce3R promoter in M. tuberculosis during the in vitro culture condition tested.
