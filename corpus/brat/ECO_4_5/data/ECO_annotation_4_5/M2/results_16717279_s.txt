RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Weight matrix prediction of potential PhoB regulated genes

A weight matrix to identify potential PhoB binding sites was generated from five S.meliloti and ten E.coli PhoB box example sequences of 18 nt length (Table 1).
The nucleotide frequency matrix was used to calculate an information-based score for potential binding sites in a scan of the S.meliloti genome.
Putative PhoB binding sites were defined by a score of greater than 0.35 and a location between +100 and -500 nt of the translational start codon on the transcribed strand of an annotated gene (see Materials and Methods).
One hundred and three putative PhoB binding sites were found and are shown with their downstream annotated genes in Supplementary Table S1.
Seven of these promoter regions contained two putative PhoB boxes, so that 96 distinct genes were found.
Three out of four genes whose Pho boxes were used for matrix construction were also among those 96 genes.
No orthologue of orfA-pta-ackA from S.meliloti strain 104A14 was found in Rm1021 strain.

The threshold score (0.35) used to identify putative PhoB binding sites was derived from the lowest score (that of orfA-pit) among the example sequences.
With this threshold, 18 of the top 20 scores were upstream of genes found to be induced by phosphate starvation, in a PhoB-dependent manner, by gusA fusion analysis in S.meliloti (see next section).
However, most putative PhoB binding sites with scores above the cut-off level did not show phosphate-dependent regulation of transcription.
Possible explanations in addition to false positives are that the matrix method did not include other important features of a PhoB binding site, such as appropriately positioned -10 and -35 promoter elements.
It is also possible that some genes with PhoB binding sites require interaction with additional regulatory proteins before the gene can be regulated by phosphate limitation.

Blanco et al. (23) showed that the C-terminal domain of PhoB interacts with a 22 bp region of dsDNA that consists of two direct repeats of 11 bp.
Each 11 bp repeat has a conserved 7 bp region (consensus, CTGTCAT) followed by a less conserved 4 bp segment.
Our weight matrix is comprised of two conserved 7 bp repeats separated by a single, less conserved 4 bp spacer, and omits the terminal 4 bp segment.
However, this terminal segment is not well conserved (23) and will therefore contribute little to the weight matrix score.
Furthermore, our weight matrix will reliably identify overlapping PhoB sites provided that they are separated by 4 bp 'spacers' and individually have component scores greater than 0.35.



Experimental validation of the predicted Pho regulon members by analysis of transcriptional gene fusions

To directly examine whether the S.meliloti genes identified by the frequency matrix were subject to phosphate-dependent regulation, we generated transcriptional reporter gene fusions to seventy-two of these candidate genes and examined their expression in defined MOPS-buffered minimal medium during growth under Pi-excess (2 mM Pi) and Pi-starvation (no Pi added) conditions (see Materials and Methods).
Gene expression in a wild-type phoB+ background was compared with expression in an otherwise isogenic phoB- background (Table 2).
Eighteen of the 72 promoter gene fusions were induced upon Pi-starvation in a PhoB-dependent fashion (Table 2).
In addition, regardless of the media Pi concentration, gene fusions to smb20427 (putative amino acid ABC transport system), smc02886 and smc02675 (rrna) showed 3-, 2- and 10-fold more expression respectively in the wild-type background relative to the phoB- background.

Three reporter gene fusions were found to be repressed upon Pi-starvation in a PhoB-dependent manner.
These were smc00801 (transmembrane protein of unknown function), smc02601 (nadABC) and smc02862 (orfA-pit).
In the wild-type background these fusions were expressed at higher levels in media containing 2 mM Pi than in Pi-starved cells.
Also, in the phoB mutant background the expression level was elevated and did not alter with media Pi.
We have previously reported that expression of the low-affinity Pi-transport system encoded by the orfA-pit genes is repressed by PhoB (28).
The repression of smc02601- smc02602- smc02603 (nadABC) expression suggests that the observed down regulation of NAD+ synthesis in S.meliloti possibly corresponds to a slight down regulation of smc00161 expression that appears to occur upon Pi-limited growth (Table 2).
The smc00161 is annotated to encode an NH3-dependent NAD+ synthetase and the promoter region of this genes was predicted to carry a promoter Pho box (Supplementary Table S1).



Comparison of Pho box predictions with DNA microarray data

Employing DNA microarrays, Krol and Becker (31) identified 98 genes (some of which were in operons) that were more than 3-fold induced in a phoB-dependent manner upon Pi limitation.
An additional 50 genes showed a strong increase in expression under phosphate limitation in a partially phoB-dependent or phoB-independent manner.
Krol and Becker (31) also identified potential Pho-box sequences with LTEQ 2 mismatches from the Pho-box consensus sequence TG(A/T)CA (C/A)-NNNN-C(C/T)(G/T)TCA(C/T) defined by Summers et al. (16).
Of the 19 Pho-box promoters identified by Krol and Becker (31), 14 were also identified with our weight matrix (Table 3) and data from our gene fusion experiments (Table 2) revealed that 13 of these 14 genes were regulated by media Pi in a PhoB dependent manner (Table 2).
A reporter fusion to the remaining gene, sma0612 has yet to be examined.
Of the five Pho-boxes not identified by our weight matrix, four were unusual (sma1809, sma1822, smc00170 (sinR) and smc00429) as they contained 3 or 5 nt in the region flanked by the 7 nt direct repeats instead of the 4 (see Table 1).
The Pho-box upstream of the remaining gene, sma0045, lies on the opposite strand to sma0045 and thus would not be included in our predictions.
However reporter gene fusions to these genes should be analyzed as the microarray experiments suggested these genes were induced in a phoB-dependent manner (31).

In addition to the 13 Pho regulon members predicted both here and by Krol and Becker (31), both the weight matrix data and data from reporter fusion assays identified an additional 10 genes whose expression was PhoB-regulated in response to Pi limitation (Tables 2 and 3).
With the exceptions of smb20843 (algI), smc00618(ppk), smc02601(nadA) and smc00801(hypothetical, global homology), these genes also showed PhoB-dependent transcription in microarray studies.
The failure to detect repression of smc02601(nadA) and smc00801expression in microarray experiments is not surprising as the microarray experiments also failed to detect orfA-pit repression and this operon is known to be repressed by PhoB (25).
The failure to detect induction of smb20843 (algI), smc00618 (ppk), upon Pi-starvation is more surprising as these genes appear to be highly regulated in the gene fusion experiments.
Moreover expression of ppk is known to be Pi-starvation induced in many organisms.
The differences between the microarray and gene fusion data could result from several factors including differences in experimental growth conditions as in microarray experiments cells were grown in 100 microM Pi source as the Pi-limitation condition.
Alternatively, it is possible that the particular probes employed for ppk and smb20843 yielded low signals.
Through our weight matrix scan, Pho-box sequences were also found upstream of three more genes, sma2410 (rhbF), smc01296 (rpsN) and smc01820 (putative N-carbamyl-L-amino acid aminohydrolase) (Supplementary Table S1).
Promoter fusions to these three genes have not been tested yet.
These genes however are shown to be repressed in a PhoB-independent manner in microarray studies (31).
Further studies are required to analyze the regulation of these genes and the nature of their associated Pho-box sequences.

We note that in the case of orfA-pit, the Pho-box identified by Krol and Becker (31) lay on the opposite strand to the orfA-pit genes and is different from that identified by Bardin et al. (28).
Since orfA-pit expression is negatively regulated by PhoB, it is of interest to determine the actual PhoB binding site as little is known regarding how PhoB represses transcription.
In summary, of 96 genes with upstream Pho-boxes predicted by the frequency matrix genome analysis, 34 appear to be Pi and PhoB regulated as revealed from gene fusion and microarray analysis data (Table 3).



Analysis of predicted Pho regulon members across proteobacterial genomes

It is reasonable to assume that at least part of the physiological response to Pi-limitation will be conserved.
As the Pho-box sequence identified by the PhoB proteins of different organisms appears to be conserved (14,16,24,28,42 - 44), we used the Pho-box frequency matrix described above (Table 1) to search the genomes of twelve gram negative bacteria (Table 4) for PhoB-binding sites using the same criteria as employed for S.meliloti.
Genes that lay downstream of a predicted Pho-box with scores greater than 0.35 were further examined.
We identified genes, such as pstSCAB, phoA, ugpA, phn and ppk that are known to be associated with phosphate metabolism (Tables 5 - 7).
The pstS gene encodes the Pi-binding protein of the high affinity PstSCAB transport system (18,27) and expression of this system in E.coli, S.meliloti and Pseudomonas aeruginosa is known to be highly induced under Pi-limiting conditions and is PhoB dependent (27).
In a number of organisms, such as Caulobacter crescentus, the pstS gene transcript is separate from the pstCAB-phoUB transcript and in these cases predicted Pho-boxes are also located upstream of the pstC gene (see Table 5).

It was striking that multiple18 bp Pho-box sequences were predicted upstream of the pst genes in all of the genomes examined (Table 5).
Multiple Pho-boxes consisted of overlapping 7 bp direct repeats separated by 4 bp spacers.
The frequency matrix detected consecutive 18 bp elements and adding a terminal 4 bp spacer formed consecutive 22 bp PhoB binding sites as defined by Blanco et al. (23).
The two 11 bp direct repeat sequences bind the PhoB monomers head to tail (23).
The pstS promoters from E.coli K12 and O157:H7 are predicted to contain five and six of these 11 bp direct repeats, respectively.
The large number of Pho-boxes in all of the pstS promoter regions presumably reflects the importance of the PstSCAB high affinity transport system in the uptake of Pi under Pi-limiting conditions.
Other genes associated with phosphate metabolism for which multiple Pho-boxes sequences were detected included alkaline phosphatase-like proteins (phoA), genes involved in phosphonate uptake and metabolism (phn), in glycerol-3-phosphate uptake (ugp and glp), the regulatory genes phoB and phoR (Table 5) and genes encoding polyphosphate kinase (Table 6).

In addition to the previously reported Pho-box in the orfA-pit promoter region of S.meliloti, Pho-box sequences were also detected in the promoter region of the orfA-pit orthologues in the alpha-proteobacteria, Bradyrhizobium japonicum and Mesorhizobium loti and the gamma-proteobacteria Pseudomonas putida and Acinetobacter sp (Table 5).
Bardin et al. (28) showed that the expression of orfA-pit in S.meliloti is repressed upon Pi-starvation, unlike in E.coli where the pit genes appear to be constitutively expressed (45) and for which no Pho-boxes were detected.
The identification of putative Pho-boxes upstream of the orfA-pit genes in other bacteria suggests that these may also be repressed by Pi-starvation and that such repression may be a widespread phenomenon.

A number of predicted Pho regulon members not normally associated with Pi metabolism were identified in several genomes (Table 7).
One of the genes in this category was katA encoding catalase and was recently shown to be PhoB dependent in S.meliloti and P.aeruginosa in Pi-starvation conditions (46).
The detection of Pho-box elements upstream of the katA genes of C.crescentus and P.putida suggests that katA expression in these organisms is also PhoB regulated.
Pho-boxes upstream of several S.meliloti ABC-class transport systems were also detected upstream of homologous clusters in other bacteria.
These were smc01605, smc04317 (afuA) and smc03124 (Table 7).
Both the afuABC and smc01605 gene clusters in S.meliloti are annotated as putatively involved in Fe+3 transport, however definitive evidence is lacking.
Choa et al., (47) did not find either of these ABC transport systems to be up-regulated in S.meliloti when grown in iron-limiting conditions.
Therefore, it appears unlikely that they are actually involved in iron transport.
A third ABC system in S.meliloti, smc03124, with conserved Pho-box sequences in other proteobacteria (Table 7), is annotated as a putative peptide binding protein.
The actual substrate(s) transported by this system is unknown.

We identified a putative Pho-box upstream of smc00772 (potH)- gene clusters well as orthologues in M.loti and Brucella suis (Table 7).
Although fusion data for smc00772 is unavailable, the potFGHI ABC-class, putative putrescine transporter cluster was identified as upregulated by Pi-limitation in the microarray analysis (31), although no Pho-box was identified by them.
The putative Pho-box upstream of smc00772 (potH) lies within the coding region of potG (smc00771), instead of upstream of the regulator (potF).
The fact that Pho-box-like sequences were identified upstream of genes similar to S.meliloti potH in M.loti and B.suis suggest that putrescine transport may be PhoB-regulated across a range of organisms and should be further investigated.

In response to Pi-starvation, S.meliloti replaces phospholipids with other non-Pi-containing lipids sulphoquinovosyl diacylglycerols (SL), ornithine-containing lipids (OL) and diacylglyceryl-N,N,N-trimethylhomoserines (DGTS) (48,49).
In Rhodobacter sphaeroides it was demonstrated that the smc01848 homolog btaA is directly involved in DGTS biosynthesis (50) and recently Lopez-Lara et al. (51) established that smc01848 and smc01849 (btaAB) are required for DGTS synthesis.
A Pho-box is predicted 64 nt from the smc01848 start codon and orthologs of smc01848 in M.loti (mlr1574) and Agrobacterium tumefaciens (atu2119) also have predicted Pho boxes in the corresponding promoter regions (Table 5).
These data strongly suggest that DGTS synthesis induced upon Pi limitation is mediated directly via PhoR-PhoB system.



Pi starvation and polyphosphate metabolism

Inorganic polyphosphates (polyPi) are linear polymers of orthophosphate residues linked by high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds.
These polymers can vary in size from 3 to over 1000 phosphate residues.
PolyPi is ubiquitous and the enzyme primarily responsible for polyPi synthesis in E.coli is polyP kinase (PPK), which uses the gamma phosphate of ATP to make the polymer.
PolyPi can also be hydrolyzed to Pi either by exopolyhosphatases (PPX) or by endopolyphosphatases (PPN).
The identification and assignment of Pho-boxes was sometimes complicated by differences in genome annotation, as in the case of genes encoding polyphosphate kinase (ppk) (Table 6).
Here Pho boxes were predicted in the ppk promoter regions of 10 of the 12 genomes examined.
However, the predicted Pho-box from both M.loti (52) and C.crescentus (53) were located within the annotated gene coding regions.
Alignment of the Ppk amino acid sequence suggests that the actual start codons of the ppk genes in M.loti and C.crescentus are downstream of the annotated start codons (data not shown).
Our reporter gene fusion data showed that the S.meliloti ppk gene was strongly induced member of the Pho regulon.
However, most strikingly, the weight matrix did not detect a ppk Pho box either from the E.coli K12 genome or the E.coli O157 genome, even at very low cut-off (0.18).
In E.coli there is genetic evidence demonstrated that polyphosphates accumulate upon Pi starvation and depend on PhoB, although the E.coli ppk promoter has never been mapped.
Therefore, it is likely that E.coli PhoB regulates ppk indirectly as suggested elsewhere (54).
