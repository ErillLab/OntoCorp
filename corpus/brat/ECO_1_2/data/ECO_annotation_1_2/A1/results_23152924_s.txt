The arcA Mutant Produces High Levels of 3OC6 Pheromone

Previous work in V. fischeri showed arcA and arcB mutants have bright luminescence in culture relative to the parent strain [50], [52].
Since luxI, the 3OC6 synthase gene, is encoded in the same operon as the genes directly involved in generating bioluminescence, we predicted that an arcA mutant would also produce more 3OC6 pheromone than wild type.
We found that at an OD595 of 2.0 when cultures are near peak luminescence, DeltaarcA mutant cultures contained on average 55 nM 3OC6 pheromone while the wild-type, luxI, and DeltaarcA luxI mutant cultures were below the level of detection for the assay (<1 nM).
Thus, as predicted, ArcA mediates repression of not only bioluminescence but also 3OC6 pheromone synthesis.



Bright Luminescence of the arcA Mutant is Mostly due to 3OC6-mediated Positive Feedback

The ~500-fold increase in luminescence in arcA mutants (documented previously [52]) should be a combined effect of the loss of direct, ArcA-dependent repression of the lux operon together with the 3OC6-mediated positive feedback inherent in the LuxR-LuxI regulatory circuit.
To test the relative importance of these two effects we first assayed luminescence in a DeltaarcA mutant strain with or without a functional luxI 3OC6 synthase gene.
It is important to note that under these broth culture conditions, LuxR-mediated activation of the lux operon in ES114 is stimulated primarily by C8 [63], which is the product of AinS [68], [69].
C8 measurements ranged from 150 to 500 nM in different experiments but were never significantly different between ES114 and the DeltaarcA mutant (p>0.2).
The arcA mutant was >350-times more luminescent than wild type; however, in the luxI mutant background, the arcA mutation had only a 2-fold effect on luminescence (Fig. 2A).
Similarly, we saw a much greater effect of the DeltaarcA allele on a Plux-lacZ reporter in the wild-type background (10-fold) than in a luxI mutant (2-fold) (Fig. 2B).
These results indicate that in the absence of ArcA-dependent repression of lux, bright bioluminescence is mediated primarily through the 3OC6-dependent positive feedback regulation of the lux genes.

To further explore the relative regulatory strengths of 3OC6-mediated positive feedback and direct repression of lux by ArcA, we tested whether addition of 3OC6 at concentrations found in cultures of the DeltaarcA mutant could overcome ArcA-mediated repression of lux in wild-type cells.
When 50 nM 3OC6 (the amount accumulated in arcA mutant cultures) was added to wild-type cultures, luminescence increased to levels comparable to that found in the DeltaarcA mutant (Fig. 2C).
Taken together, the results above suggested that ArcA-mediated repression of lux might be rendered inconsequential if cells have previously induced LuxI-mediated positive feedback or if a distinct population of neighboring cells lacks active ArcA-mediated repression of lux.
Below we describe tests of both of these ideas.



3OC6-mediated Positive Feedback Results in Irreversible Luminescence Induction

Because an arcA mutant produces high levels of 3OC6 and exogenous 3OC6 can overcome ArcA-mediated lux repression, we asked whether ArcA can repress luminescence once the LuxI-mediated positive feedback circuit is initiated.
To test this, we constructed an IPTG-inducible arcA expression vector (pAS104) and moved it into an arcA mutant to control when arcA is expressed.
When the arcA mutant carrying pAS104 was grown in aerobic shake flasks without IPTG, luminescence reached the same high level observed when the empty vector was present (data not shown), suggesting ArcA expression in the absence of IPTG was low enough to have little regulatory impact.
When IPTG was present from the start of the experiment (T0), luminescence was repressed to a level similar to that of the wild-type control (Fig. 3).
However, when IPTG was added to cultures after luminescence was induced (T1), arcA expression was no longer able to repress luminescence, resulting in cultures with bright luminescence similar to that in the DeltaarcA mutant without IPTG (Fig. 3).
These results suggest that once 3OC6-mediated positive feedback is initiated fully by the loss of Arc-dependent repression, expression of ArcA cannot reverse this effect.



3OC6 from arcA Mutant Cells can Induce Luminescence in Neighboring Cells in Culture

We next asked whether 3OC6 from arcA mutant cells could induce luminescence in neighboring wild-type cells, overcoming ArcA-mediated repression of lux in the wild-type population.
To examine this possibility we tested whether a dark (DeltaluxCDABEG) arcA mutant could induce luminescence in wild-type cells in a 3OC6-dependent manner.
When wild-type cells are co-cultured in the presence of dark (DeltaluxCDABEG) arcA mutant cells in shake flasks, the specific luminescence of the wild-type cells increases nearly 500-fold (Fig. 4A), and this luminescence induction is dependent on luxI and 3OC6 pheromone production in the arcA mutant cells (Fig. 4B).

Additionally, we asked whether pheromone produced by the arcA mutant could be communicated across a distance when strains were spatially segregated.
To test this we streaked wild-type and luxI mutant cultures onto an agar plate next to a spot of dark arcA mutant culture.
After incubation, the wild-type streak showed high luminescence nearest the pheromone-producing arcA mutant, with elevated but diminishing luminescence in cells further from the pheromone source extending ~15 mm (Fig. 4C).
In contrast, the luxI mutant streak showed increased luminescence only nearest to the arcA mutant (Fig. 4C).
The luminescence induction observed in both wild-type and luxI mutant streaks was dependent on luxI and 3OC6 synthesis in the dark arcA mutant (data not shown).
The difference between luminescence of the wild-type and luxI streaks in Figure 4C presumably reflects induction in the luxI streak only by 3OC6 diffusing from the arcA mutant, whereas cells in the wild-type streak amplify the 3OC6 signal by positive feedback to extend the distance over which luminescence is induced.
These results indicate that LuxI-mediated positive feedback considerably expands the range of this Arc-controlled signaling response.



3OC6 from One Population of Symbiotic Cells can Induce Luminescence in 3OC6-deficient Cells in the Squid Light Organ

Theoretically, inter-strain induction of luminescence such as that shown in Figure 4 could reflect a similar phenomenon in the light organ, with a subpopulation inducing luminescence in a broader population through amplification and diffusion of pheromone originating from a distinct subgroup.
Therefore, we were interested in testing whether a subpopulation of symbiotic cells can induce luminescence in the wider community in the squid light organ.
While the intercellular signaling experiments described above used arcA mutants as a subpopulation of cells with altered regulation of pheromone synthesis, we did not use arcA mutants in the squid colonization experiment described below.
Previous studies showed wild-type V. fischeri cells produce high levels of pheromone in the light organ [48].
Moreover, ArcA does not repress luminescence in symbiotic cells [52], suggesting ArcA most likely does not repress pheromone synthesis in these cells as well.
For these reasons, we used arcA + V. fischeri strains to test for intercellular signaling in the squid light organ.

To determine if a subpopulation of cells can induce luminescence in the wider light organ community, aposymbiotic juvenile squid were co-infected with a 1:1 mixture of a gfp-labeled dark mutant (DeltaluxCDABEG), that can still synthesize 3OC6, and a rfp-labeled luxI mutant that cannot make 3OC6.
Neither strain alone can induce symbiotic luminescence [63] (Fig. 5A).
However, when these strains co-colonize the light organ, if sufficient pheromone from the gfp-labeled dark mutant can diffuse into the pheromone deficient rfp-labeled strain, luminescence should be observed.
24 hr after infection, luminescence values were recorded for each squid before it was dissected and imaged with an epifluorescence microscope to visualize the spatial distribution of the two strains within the light organ (Fig. 5B).
We observed wild-type levels of luminescence in the rfp-labeled luxI mutant cells in the squid when co-infecting the light organ with a dark 3OC6-producing strain (Fig. 5C).
Interestingly, even when the dark pheromone-donor strain (DeltaluxCDABEG) comprised as little as 8% of the light organ population in a mixed infection with the 3OC6-deficient (luxI) strain, the latter achieved luminescence comparable to that of wild-type in a clonal infection, and this robust induction of the luxI mutant by the dark strain occurred despite significant segregation of the two strains in the light organ.
These results indicate that 3OC6-mediated intercellular signaling can occur between distinct subpopulations of symbiotic cells and that high levels of 3OC6 synthesis in only a subset of the population are sufficient to induce luminescence fully in the remaining cells occupying the light organ.
