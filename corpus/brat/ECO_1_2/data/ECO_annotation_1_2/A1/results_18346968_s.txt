Measurement of melR promoter activity: repression by MelR

The starting point of this work was the TB20 EcoRI - HindIII fragment that covers the intergenic region between the divergent E. coli melR and melA genes and the translation start points.
This fragment, together with the TB22, TB23 and TB10 truncated derivatives (Figure 1A), was cloned into pRW50, a lac expression vector, to generate melR promoter::lac fusions.
To measure MelR-dependent repression of melR promoter activity, the pRW50 derivatives carrying the TB20, TB22, TB23 or TB10 fragments were transformed into WAM1321 DeltamelR Deltalac cells containing either pJW15, encoding melR, or empty control vector, pJWDeltamelR and beta-galactosidase activities were measured.
The results, illustrated in Figure 1B, show that, with the TB20 fragment cloned in pRW50, MelR causes a >5-fold reduction in beta-galactosidase expression.
Similar repression is seen with the TB22 fragment, in which melAB promoter sequences upstream of MelR-binding site 2 have been removed.
In contrast, and in full agreement with the previous results of Wade et al. (17), the longer deletion in the TB23 fragment, that removes MelR binding site 2, results in a sharp reduction in the repression of the melR promoter by MelR.
This reduced repression is unchanged by the longer deletion in the TB10 fragment.

Next, we attempted to reproduce MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter in vitro.
To do this, the TB22 and TB23 fragments were cloned into plasmid pSR such that the melR promoter was placed upstream of the bacteriophage lambda oop factor-independent terminator.
The recombinant plasmids were incubated with purified RNA polymerase holoenzyme and the activator, CRP, and radiolabelled nucleoside triphosphates were added.
Analysis of the RNA products, shows that two discrete RNA species were produced (Figure 2).
These correspond to the plasmid-encoded RNA-1 (108 nt) and a longer 138 base transcript that initiates at the melR promoter and runs to the oop terminator.
Note that the production of the 138 base RNA, but not RNA-1, is dependent on the inclusion of CRP in the assay (control experiments not shown).
The experiment illustrated in Figure 2 shows that MelR has little or no effect on the synthesis of RNA-1 but represses synthesis of the transcript from the melR promoter.
In accord with the in vivo assays (Figure 1B), repression is greater with the TB22 template, which includes MelR-binding site 2, than with the TB23 template.




Orientation of MelR bound at site R

Wade et al. (17) showed that MelR-binding site R is essential for MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter, and Figure 3A shows the proposed 18-bp binding sequence compared to the consensus (7).
In another study (16), it was found that base pairs 5 and 13 of the consensus sequence make important contacts with the side chains of amino acids N222 and R273, respectively, in the first and second helix - turn - helix motifs of the MelR DNA-binding domain.
To confirm the location of site R and its orientation, three derivatives of the TB20 fragment, carrying base substitutions at position 5 or position 13 of the proposed site R sequence, were constructed (Figure 3A).
MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter carried by each derivative was then measured, as above.
Results illustrated in Figure 3B show that the 5C substitution, which removes the consensus G base at position 5, reduced MelR-dependent repression.
Furthermore, though the base at position 13 is the non-consensus A, substitution with a T also reduces MelR-dependent repression.
In contrast, MelR-dependent repression is enhanced by the 13G change which introduces a consensus G.


To determine experimentally the orientation of MelR bound at site R we used complementary genetic and biochemical approaches.
First, we exploited the observation that the RV273 substitution in helix - turn - helix 2, permits MelR to recognize binding targets with a T at position 13 (20).
Results in Figure 3C show that Val273 MelR gives a small enhancement in repression of the melR promoter carrying the 13T substitution in site R, compared to wild-type MelR.
In contrast, repression of the 5C derivative is reduced with Val273 MelR.
These data are consistent with a model in which helix - turn - helix 2 of MelR contacts the downstream part of site R, with residue 273 interacting with the base pair at position 13.
To confirm this, we used a preparation of purified MelR that had been labelled with an inorganic DNA cleavage reagent at residue 269, adjacent to helix - turn - helix 2 (16).
The reagent, p-bromoacetamidobenzyl-EDTA-Fe (Fe-BABE), generates a pulse of hydroxyl radicals that can be used to find the location of DNA binding of a protein and its orientation (26 - 28), and previously we exploited this to determine the orientation of MelR binding at sites 1', 1, 2 and 2' (16).
Figure 4A shows the pattern of DNA cleavage due to Fe-BABE covalently attached at residue 269 of purified MelR, bound at site R.
As expected, two sets of bands are observed.
These result from cleavage at minor grooves on either side of the site where helix - turn - helix 2 is bound, which occurs as a pulse of hydroxyl radicals encounters the neighbouring DNA.
Figure 4B shows the location of these sites of cleavage in the context of MelR-binding site R.
The results confirm that helix - turn - helix 2 of MelR binds to the downstream half of site R and hence MelR must bind in opposite orientations at site R and site 2 (Figure 1A).




CRP is not needed for MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter

To investigate the possibility that the activator CRP is required for repression of the melR promoter by MelR, we constructed derivatives of the TB20 fragment carrying mutations that inactivated either or both DNA sites for CRP, and measured MelR-dependent repression (Figure 5A).
Thus, TB201 is a derivative of TB20 in which the DNA site for CRP located between MelR site 1 and site 2 (CRP1) is inactivated.
Results illustrated in Figure 5B show that MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter is unaffected when CRP binding at this target is prevented.
It is more complicated to investigate the DNA site for CRP located 41-bp upstream of the melR transcript startpoint (CRP2) because its inactivation leads to loss of melR promoter activity (11).
Hence, we constructed the TB210 fragment, in which the melR promoter - 10 hexamer element was changed from 5' CATAAT 3' to the consensus 5' TATAAT 3'.
This change confers partial CRP independence on the melR promoter (data not shown) and also causes a small reduction in MelR-dependent repression.
We then constructed the TB211 fragment in which the CRP2 site was inactivated, and TB222, in which both DNA sites for CRP were inactivated (Figure 5A).
Results illustrated in Figure 5B show that the MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter in the TB210 fragment is unchanged in the TB211 and TB222 derivatives.
This indicates that CRP binding plays little or no role in MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter.




Other determinants for MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter

To investigate the effects of altering the spacing between MelR-binding site R and the upstream sites, derivatives of the TB22 fragment with 5- or 10-bp deletions, or with 5-, 41- or 91-bp insertions were constructed (see Figure 6A and Materials and methods section).
MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter in each of the new constructs was measured as above and the results are illustrated in Figure 6B.
The data show that repression is reduced by deletion of 5 bp but is restored in the 10-bp deletion construct.
Similarly, repression is reduced by insertion of 5 bp but is restored, at least partially, by the 41- or 91-bp insertions.
In our previous study (17), we reported that repression of the melR promoter by MelR was unaffected by point mutations in either site 1 or site 1'.
However, it was subsequently found that, whilst these point mutations weakened MelR binding at these targets, their occupation by MelR was not prevented (Mohamed El-Robh, unpublished results).
Hence, the TB28 fragment, in which both site 1 and site 1' were replaced by unrelated sequence, was constructed (see Figure 6A and Materials and methods section).
Results illustrated in Figure 6B show that MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter in the TB28 fragment is reduced.
This suggests that occupation of sites 1 and 1' by MelR plays a role in repression.




In vitro studies of MelR binding at the melR promoter

Our results show that MelR-dependent repression of the melR promoter is contingent on MelR binding to site R and is somehow modulated by MelR binding to upstream sites 2, 1 and 1'.
Hence an electromobility shift assay (Figure 7) and a DNAase I footprinting experiment (Figure 8) were used to investigate the occupation of the different binding sites at the TB22 and TB28 promoters by purified MelR.


The electromobility shift assay shows that MelR forms more stable complexes at the TB22 promoter than at the TB28 promoter (Figure 7).
With the TB22 fragment, three clear shifted bands are observed.
DNAase I footprinting (Figure 8) suggests that these bands are due to the successive occupation of MelR-binding sites 1 and 1', site 2 and site R. With the TB28 fragment, two weaker bands are seen (Figure 7).
DNAase I footprinting shows that these result from MelR binding at site 2 and at site R, and quantification of scans of the gel shows that MelR binding to site R is weakened by at least 2-fold.

In the next experiments, we used AFM to visualize the binding of purified MelR to its targets in the TB22 promoter fragment, to attempt to establish whether DNA loop formation is a feature of the MelR binding.
To do this, we exploited an 821-bp SspI - NdeI restriction fragment (Figure 9), which contains the 251-bp TB22 EcoRI - HindIII fragment (Figure 1A) with a short 190-bp extension upstream of the EcoRI site and a longer 380-bp segment downstream from the HindIII site.
A mixture containing purified MelR and the DNA fragment was deposited onto a nickel chloride-treated mica surface and imaged by AFM using a cantilever in tapping mode.
DNA fragments and MelR - DNA complexes were visualized, and typical examples are shown in Figure 9 (with more examples and data in Figure 2 of the online Supplementary Data).
The cluster of the binding sites 2, 1 and 1' is at a distance from site R that would allow clear visualization of a DNA loop, but no sign of such loops was apparent in any of the ~100 images of complexes that we examined.
Instead, DNA-bound MelR appears as distinct oval foci at a distance of ~59 - 64 nm from one end of the DNA fragments.
While the length of the shorter DNA arm was approximately the same in all complexes, the length of the longer DNA arm appeared shorter in a third of the complexes.
In the examples shown in Figure 9, the longer arm is 205 nm in one complex and 158 nm in the other, and more examples are shown in Supplementary Figure 2.
We noticed that the foci due to MelR binding were consistently bigger in the complexes with the shortened arm.
In the images shown in Figure 9, the MelR focus is 15 x 33 nm across the shortest and longest axes of the oval in the complex with the shortened arm (right hand panel), compared to 9 x 12 nm in the other complex (centre panel).
The simplest explanation for these observations, that is consistent with the location of sites in the DNA fragment (Figure 9), is that one type of complex contains 3 MelR molecules bound at sites 2, 1 and 1' (centre panel), whilst the other contains 4 MelR molecules bound at sites 2, 1, 1' and R (right panel).
Thus there is an apparent progressive shortening of the end-to-end contour length of the DNA from the naked DNA to the MelR-2-1-1' complex and to the MelR-2-1-1'-R complex.
The shortening appears to be due to compaction of the DNA between bound MelR molecules rather than to looping.
Note a loop formed from the DNA between MelR bound at sites 2, 1, 1' and bound at site R would have a diameter of ~13 nm and this is well within the range of sizes visualized in other studies that used the same methodology (29 - 31).
