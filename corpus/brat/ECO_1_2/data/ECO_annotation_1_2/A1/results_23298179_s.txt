Deletion of the sigH gene causes a drastic change in the pH response of the F0F1-ATPase operon

In the C. glutamicum genome, the sigH gene (621 nt, access No. BX 927147.1, Kalinowski et al., 2003) is preceded upstream by an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a hypothetical protein, and is followed in the same orientation by a small gene encoding a putative anti-sigma factor (cg0877), also named rsrA o rshA.
The sigH and cg0877 genes are separated by only three nucleotides.
Downstream of cg0877 and separated by 232 bp in the complementary strand, is located the whiB1 gene (also named whcE, Kim et al., 2005b) that encodes a transcriptional factor.

As reported previously, C. glutamicum is an alkaliphilic microorganism and the F0F1-ATPase operon is expressed optimally at pH 9.0 (Barriuso-Iglesias et al., 2006).
Since a putative SigH binding site was found in the promoter of the atpBEFHAGDC operon encoding the F0F1-ATPase complex, we decided to compare expression of this operon in the wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 and in a DeltasigH mutant derived from it (Engels et al., 2004).

Northern analysis of the transcripts formed from the atpBEFHAGDC operon in the wild-type strain were made using the probes named B, B1, B2 and D, internal to atpB (probes B, B1 and B2) and atpD genes respectively.
The size of the transcripts (7.5 and 1.2 kb) was the same in the wild type and the DeltasigH mutant, but the pattern of response to pH was clearly different (Fig. 1).
The best results were obtained with probes B, B2 and D. Using probes B or B2 we observed two transcripts of 7.5 and 1.2 kb respectively, as described for the wild-type (Barriuso-Iglesias et al., 2006).
With probe D, only the 7.5 kb transcript was found.
The large 7.5 kb transcript corresponds to a polycistronic transcript of the atpBEFHAGDC operon, whereas the short 1.2 kb transcript obtained with probes B or B2, but not with probe D, corresponds to a monocistronic mRNA of the first gene of the operon.

Interestingly, whereas maximal expression of the F0F1-ATPase operon in the wild-type strain was observed at pH 9.0 with any of the three probes (Barriuso-Iglesias et al., 2006), optimal expression of this operon in the DeltasigH mutant occurred at pH 7.0 (Fig. 1).
These results suggest that expression of the F0F1-ATPase operon is under the control of the ECF sigmaH factor.



Transcriptional organization of the sigH-cg0877 region

SigH is encoded by a 621 nt ORF and is very closely linked to cg0877 (3 nt separation).
In order to study the transcriptional response of sigH to pH stress, we analysed the transcription of sigH using a sensitive RNA - RNA hybridization procedure with an antisense RNA probe (see Experimental procedures).
The 615 nt RNA probe obtained was named probe H (Fig. 2A).

Hybridizations with total RNA of the wild-type C. glutamicum grown at pH 6.0, 7.0 and 9.0 using the same amount of total RNA showed a single 0.9 kb transcript that appears to correspond to the bi-cistronic transcript of sigH and cg0877 [Correction added on 28 January 2013 after first online publication: the text in parenthesis referring to 16S rRNA probe has been deleted from the above statement].
The expression of these genes was clearly higher at alkaline pH (9.0) than at lower pH 7.0 (Fig. 2C).

The possible joint transcription of sigH and cg0877 (encoding a putative anti-sigma factor) was supported by the lack of an identifiable separate promoter for cg0877 and by the finding of a putative strong transcriptional terminator downstream of cg0877 formed by an inverted repeat sequence of 72 nt, with a calculated DeltaG of -40 kcal mol-1 (Fig. 2B).
This putative transcriptional terminator belongs to the type I, or Mycobacterium type (Unniraman et al., 2002), and is located 87 nt downstream of cg0877 stop codon (see Discussion).



Identification of the SigH-encoded protein

A very high expression of sigH was obtained in Escherichia coli cultures at 37 degrees C following addition of IPTG (0.1 mM).
However, under these conditions most of the SigH protein was insoluble (inclusion bodies, Fig. 3A).
The best condition to obtain soluble SigH protein was growing the culture at 25 degrees C before and after induction with a 0.3 mM IPTG concentration (Fig. 3B).
A band of the expected size (49 kDa) for the GST - SigH protein was observed in extracts of the induced cultures as compared with the non-induced ones (Fig. 3C).
The identity of the induced protein was confirmed by inmunodetection with anti-GST antibodies (Fig. 3D).

The fused GST - SigH protein was purified from the soluble fraction of E. coli transformants containing the pGEX - SigH construction using GST-Trap HP colums, as described in Experimental procedures.
After washing with 15 ml of PBS buffer, the GST - SigH protein was eluted with 10 mM reduced glutathione in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 8.0.
The fractions were collected, analysed by SDS-PAGE and tested with antibodies against GST.
As shown in Fig. 3D, almost all of GST - SigH protein (reactive with anti-GST antibodies) was found in fractions 5 - 8 of the 20 collected fractions.
In this way, about 500 mug of pure GST - SigH protein was obtained per 100 ml of E. coli culture.
The nature of the purified protein was identified by peptide mass fingerprinting as described in Experimental procedures.



The purified GST - SigH binds to the atpBEFHAGDC operon promoter

Binding of the purified GST - SigH protein to the promoter of the atpBEFHAGDC operon was tested by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA).
For this purpose, the f0f1 operon promoter was cloned as a 357 bp DNA fragment using a high fidelity DNA polymerase (Platinum (R) Pfx, Invitrogen) and oligonucleotides PxB-U and PxB-D2 as primers (Table 1).
The amplified DNA fragment was purified by filtration through GFX PCR DNA and gel band purification kit (GE Healthcare) and cloned in pGEM (R) -T Easy (this construction was named pGEM-Pf0f1).

Promoter DNA-binding assays were performed with the purified GST - SigH protein in buffers A and B, differing essentially in the magnesium salt utilized and in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in buffer B.

Results of the binding experiments are shown in Fig. 4.
It is observed that there is a good binding of the GST - SigH protein, but not of the separate GST protein used as control, to the labelled F0F1-ATPase promoter, in buffer A; however, binding was barely visible in buffer B (not shown), indicating that some of the components of this buffer (most likely PEG) are unfavourable for the protein-DNA interaction.
The intensity of the retarded band was proportional to the amount of GST - SigH protein used (25 - 100 pmol) and the labelled band was not formed when the reaction was supplemented with additional unlabelled probe.
These results show that SigH binds to the promoter of the atpBEFHAGDC operon and, therefore, participates in the pH control of this operon in C. glutamicum.
The used DNA fragment contains the consensus sequence GGAT ... 18nt ... GTTA in the -35 to -10 region of the promoter.
