The ompR mutant is non-motile and non-flagellated

Swimming motility assays were performed with the wild-type Ye9 and Ye9N and the AR4 and EZ10 mutant strains of Y. enterocolitica at 25 and 37 degrees C. Mutant AR4 (DeltaompR::Km), lacking OmpR protein, was created as described previously (Brzostek et al. 2007).
Mutant EZ10 (envZ::pEP185.2) was constructed in this study by insertional mutagenesis.
A motility assay at 37 degrees C revealed a non-motile phenotype for all strains, as expected (data not shown).
The analysis of motility of strains Ye9, AR4 and EZ10 incubated at 25 degrees C (Fig. 1) revealed that the ompR mutant had failed to swim when compared with the strain Ye9 or the envZ mutant.
However, the envZ mutant was less motile than the wild-type strain Ye9.
In addition, the motility of Ye9N strain, a NalR derivative of Ye9, was unchanged (data not shown).
Complementation of the ompR mutation was achieved using the plasmid pHR4 (Brzostek et al. 2003), carrying the gene coding for OmpR.
The introduction of this plasmid into mutant AR4 restored swimming motility, although the motility of the AR4/pHR4 strain was slightly weaker than that of wild-type cells.
These results indicated that OmpR is required for the expression of motility.
To determine whether the loss of motility of strain AR4 was due to the absence of flagella, cells of Y. enterocolitica strains Ye9, ompR mutant AR4, envZ mutant EZ10 and AR4/pHR4 were examined by electron microscopy (Fig. 2).
Electron micrographs showed that all the cells are rod-shaped and those of the parent strain Ye9 and the envZ mutant strain EZ10 are flagellated, but the ompR mutant cells lack flagella.
The flagellated phenotype was restored to strain AR4 by the introduction of an active copy of ompR on plasmid pHR4.



Effect of growth conditions and OmpR on flhDC promoter function

To investigate OmpR-dependent activity of the flhDC promoter, an operon fusion of flhDC with the lacZ reporter gene was constructed in the wild-type strain Ye9 and in the ompR mutant AR4 to produce strains Ye11 and AR6, respectively.
The reporter fusion was created by plasmid insertion via homologous recombination.
The levels of expression of flhDC::lacZYA, as measured by beta-galactosidase assay, were compared for strains Ye11 and AR6 under different growth conditions (Fig. 3).
Complementation analyses were performed using strain AR6 carrying plasmid pBR3 encoding His-tagged OmpR (Brzostek et al. 2007).

To study the influence of OmpR and temperature on the expression of flhDC, the flhDC::lacZYA strains were grown in TB0 medium at 25, 31, 34 or 37 degrees C (Fig. 3a).
The lack of the OmpR protein in AR6 resulted in a ~3.5-fold decrease in the level of beta-galactosidase activity at 25 degrees C compared with the level obtained for strain Ye11 (524 +- 36 vs. 1762 +- 37 Miller units).
This result implied a positive role for the OmpR protein in the regulation of flhDC expression.
In addition, complementation of the ompR mutation in strain AR6 with plasmid pBR3 resulted in an increase in beta-galactosidase activity (1303 +- 80 Miller units), indicating that the His-tagged OmpR protein, expressed from the gene introduced in trans, was able to positively regulate flhDC expression.
Moreover, a ~6.5-fold reduction in beta-galactosidase activity at 31 degrees C compared with the level at 25 degrees C (1762 +- 37 vs. 138 +- 18 Miller units) was observed for strain Ye11, and an increase in the temperature up to 37 degrees C resulted in a further decrease in beta-galactosidase activity.
The same inverse relationship between temperature and the level of flhDC expression was also observed for strain AR6.
These results showed that flhDC expression is repressed by high temperature and that OmpR is not involved in the observed thermoregulation.

To examine whether OmpR modulates the expression of flhDC in response to high osmolarity, flhDC promoter activity was measured in strains grown in TB0 medium or TB0 supplemented with NaCl (Fig. 3b).
In the strain with active OmpR (Ye11), high osmolarity conditions caused a decrease in expression from the flhDC promoter.
beta-galactosidase activity was reduced ~10-fold from 2238 +- 263 Miller units at zero NaCl to 221 +- 48 Miller units at 0.3 M NaCl.
Besides the normally decreased level of flhDC expression in the ompR mutant AR6, an inhibitory effect of high osmolarity on the beta-galactosidase activity of this strain was also observed.
These results imply that OmpR may not be involved in the osmoregulation of flhDC at higher osmolarity.
To ensure that the observed effect of NaCl on flhDC expression was caused by an increase in osmolarity and not an increase in the NaCl concentration in the medium, NaCl was replaced by KCl or sorbitol.
Similarly to NaCl, the expression of flhDC decreased with the increasing concentration of the added osmolytes (data not shown).

To study the influence of pH on the expression of flhDC in the strains Ye11 and AR6, the cells were grown in TB0 medium at different pH (Fig. 3c).
The optimal pH for flhDC expression in Ye11 was found to be 7.0 (2255 +- 129 Miller units).
Raising the pH to 8.0 resulted in a ~2-fold decrease in flhDC promoter activity (1044 +- 55 Miller units).
Moreover, a shift to acidic pH values resulted in a dramatic fall in activity, with the greatest decrease of ~10-fold occurring when the pH was reduced to 5.0 (233 +- 47 Miller units).
In strain AR6 (lacking OmpR protein) grown under different pH conditions, decreases in beta-galactosidase activity were observed at pH values above and below 7.0.
The level of flhDC promoter activity declined from 668 +- 130 Miller units at pH 7.0 to 294 +- 80 Miller units at pH 8.0, and to 175 +- 32 Miller units at pH 5.0.
These results suggest that the control of flhDC expression in response to changes in pH is not mediated by the OmpR protein.



Effect of OmpR and carbon source on flhDC expression

The level of acetyl-phosphate (acetyl-P, the phosphodonor for OmpR phosphorylation) within the cell may vary considerably depending on the carbon source in the growth medium.
To determine the effect of carbon source on OmpR-dependent flhDC expression, the beta-galactosidase activity was measured for Y. enterocolitica strains Ye11 and AR6 (with and without OmpR, respectively) grown in MMA supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, glucose, pyruvate or acetate (Table 2).
A higher level of beta-galactosidase activity was obtained for the wild-type strain compared with the ompR mutant when grown on the different carbon sources.
The activity in Ye11 was highest in cells grown on acetate (757 +- 48 Miller units) and slightly lower with pyruvate (662 +- 36 Miller units).
In the presence of glycerol and glucose in the medium the flhDC expression was reduced to 505 +- 56 and 497 +- 57 Miller units, respectively.
Interestingly, the pattern of beta-galactosidase activity with the different carbon sources was different for the ompR mutant strain AR6.
No significant differences in the activity of flhDC were observed in AR6 grown in the presence of pyruvate, acetate, glycerol or glucose.



Separation of OmpR from OmpR-P by reversed phase HPLC

It has previously been shown that response regulators of two component signal transduction systems react with acetyl-P to become phosphorylated (McCleary and Stock 1994).
Phosphorylation of Y. enterocolitica OmpR in vitro was performed by treatment with 20 mM acetyl-P.
After 60 min incubation, a sample of the reaction mixture was subjected to reversed phase HPLC to separate OmpR from OmpR-P.
When OmpR was incubated with acetyl-P, two peaks were detected, eluting at 60 and 80 min (Fig. 4), in contrast to the single peak that eluted at approximately 80 min when OmpR without phosphorylation was analyzed (data not shown).
It is assumed that these two peaks correspond to OmpR-P and OmpR, respectively.



Binding of OmpR to the promoter region of flhDC examined using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs)

Bioinformatic analysis of the flhDC promoter region of Y. enterocolitica Ye9 revealed the presence of two putative OmpR binding sites located at positions from -110 to -93 nt (B1) and from -44 to -27 nt (B2) relative to the AUG start codon (Fig. 5).
These two sequences closely resemble the consensus OmpR binding site, both exhibiting 61% identity.

To determine whether OmpR binds to the flhDC promoter region containing these two putative binding sites, EMSAs were performed.
Shifted OmpR-P/DNA complexes were clearly produced when the 448-bp flhDC fragment (433 bp from the start codon) interacted with the protein at concentrations of 0.8, 1.2, 1.85 or 3.0 muM (Fig. 6a).
DNA binding was specific for the flhDC promoter fragment because no shifting of an unrelated control DNA fragment (211-bp 16S rDNA) was observed.
Furthermore, a stepwise shifting of the OmpR-P/DNA complexes was evident, which suggests the presence of more than one OmpR binding site.
This result indicated that OmpR protein interacts directly with the flhDC promoter to activate transcription.

To determine the effect of phosphorylation of OmpR, EMSAs were performed with OmpR (1.2 muM - sufficient for flhDC promoter shifting) phosphorylated by incubation with 20 mM acetyl-P for 60 min and OmpR without phosphorylation (Fig. 6b).
OmpR applied without phosphorylation was found to bind the flhDC fragment with lower affinity than the phosphorylated form.
To examine the effect of the time of phosphorylation on OmpR binding ability, EMSAs were carried out with the OmpR protein treated with acetyl-P for 15, 30, 45, 60 or 90 min.
The results shown in Fig. 6c revealed similar OmpR-P binding affinities regardless of the time of phosphorylation from 15 up to 60 min: the same amount of shifted, specific OmpR-P/DNA complexes was seen in all cases.
However, when the time of phosphorylation was increased to 90 min, a reduction in the amount of specific OmpR/DNA shifted complexes was observed (Fig. 6c, lane 2).
It may be speculated that the formation of higher order structures of OmpR during the 90 min incubation might decrease the level of phosphorylation and thus reduce DNA binding.

During our studies of OmpR binding abilities to the flhDC promoter region in Y. enterocolitica, the involvement of OmpR in the regulation of flhDC in Y. pseudotuberculosis was reported and two binding sites for OmpR in the promoter region (O1 and O2) were identified (Hu et al. 2009).
In silico examination of the nucleotide sequence, within the 448-bp flhDC promoter region of Y. enterocolitica, corresponding to the putative OmpR binding sites O1 and O2 of Y. pseudotuberculosis, led to the identification of these sequences (P1 and P2) with 66 and 50% identity to the OmpR consensus, respectively (Fig. 5).
Bioinformatic analysis also indicated that these putative P1 and P2 Y. enterocolitica binding sites for OmpR do not overlap with B1 and B2 sites revealed at the beginning of our analysis.
Moreover, the O1 and O2 sites of Y. pseudotuberculosis exhibited 64 and 94% identity to the P1 and P2 binding sites of Y. enterocolitica.
These two putative OmpR binding sites P1 and P2 were recognized in the Y. enterocoliticaflhDC promoter region, located between -425 and -409 nt (P1) and 246 and -228 nt (P2), relative to the translational start site.
To determine whether OmpR actually binds to these sequences EMSAs were performed with a PCR-amplified 196-bp fragment comprising the B1 and B2 binding sites and with a 249-bp fragment of the flhDC comprising both P1 and P2 binding sites.
Different concentrations of the purified OmpR were incubated with these fragments and the binding reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis in 6% native polyacrylamide gels.
The results presented in Fig. 7 demonstrate a stepwise shifting profile of OmpR-DNA complexes when the 196-bp flhDC and 249-bp fragment interacts with 1.6, 2.8 and 4.0 muM of the protein.
DNA binding was specific for these both flhDC fragments because the mobility of 16S rDNA was unaltered in the presence of different amounts of purified OmpR.
