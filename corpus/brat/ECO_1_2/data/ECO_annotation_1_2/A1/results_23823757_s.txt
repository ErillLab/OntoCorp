Identification of fimR

Sequence analysis of the 3' flanking region of fim operon revealed two open reading frames (ORFs), Spaf_0345 and Spaf_0344, in opposite orientations (Figure 1).
Both ORFs began with an ATG translation start codon and were preceded by a putative ribosomal binding site (RBS).
Two putative rho-independent terminators were located at 19 bp (DeltaG degrees ===-4.7 kcal mol-1) and 52 bp (DeltaG degrees ===-4.2 kcal mol-1) 3' to the stop codon of Spaf_0345, respectively.
An inverted repeat (DeltaG degrees ===-1.9 kcal mol-1) was found 33 bp 3' to the stop codon of Spaf_0344.
The deduced amino acid (aa) sequence of Spaf_0345 shares significant homology with a hypothetical protein of Streptococcus australis ATCC 700641 (HMPREF9961_1041, 74% identity) and S. sanguinis SK36 (SSA_0258, 41% identity).
Additional homologues were found in S. mutans UA159 (SMU.741, 38% identity) and Streptococcus agalactiae 2603V/R (SAG0713, 35% identity).
Thus far no functional analysis of Spaf_0345 is available.
Of note, the expression of Spaf_0345 was evident by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, albeit the expression level of Spaf_0345 is only approximately 15% of that of dnaA in cells at mid-exponential growth phase (data not shown).
Spaf_0344 shares significant homology at the deduced aa level with ScaR (65% identity) of S. gordonii CH1 (AF182402_1) and with SloR (55% identity) of S. mutans UA159 (NP_720655.1).
Both ScaR and SloR belong to the DtxR family proteins, which are composed of an N-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif, followed by a metal binding and dimerization domain.
Both regions are present in Spaf_0344, and the conserved His-79, Glu-83 and His-98 in the metal binding region I of DtxR [29] all were found in the corresponding locations in Spaf_0344.
On the other hand, among the conserved residues in the metal binding region II of DtxR, only His-106 was found in Spaf_0344.
The expression level of Spaf_0344 is comparable with that of dnaA in the exponential growth phase (data not shown).
As ScaR participates in the expression regulation of S. gordonii sca operon [14], an ortholog of the S. parasanguinis FW213 fim operon, Spaf_0344 was designated fimR.



FimR Negatively Regulated the Expression of pfim

Sequence analysis reveals two inverted repeats in the intergenic region of pepO and fimC (Figure 2A), the potential targets of the DtxR-family proteins [14].
To analyze the impact of FimR on fim operon expression and its possible binding region, a series of pfim-chloramphenicol (Cm) acetyltransferase gene (cat) fusion derivatives with different lengths of the 5' flanking region were established in the wild-type and fimR-deficient (DeltafimR) S. parasanguinis as detailed in the materials and methods.
Of note, all fusions were tagged with a spectinomycin (Sp) resistance gene (spe) [30] at the 5' end of the fusion.
The spe cassette contains a strong terminator and is in the same transcription direction as the fusion, thus preventing any possible read through effect from the 5' flanking region.
Since regulatory proteins of DtxR family are generally activated by multiple metal ions, the promoter activity in all strains was determined in cells grown in the complex medium, Todd-Hewitt (TH) broth.
A basal and unregulated Cm acetyltransferase (CAT) expression was observed in strains with the pfim(33 b)-cat fusion (Figure 2B).
With all other fusion constructs, a lower level of CAT activity was detected in the wild-type background than that in DeltafimR (P<0.01, Student's t test), indicating that FimR represses the expression of pfim.
A comparable expression level was detected in strains harboring pfim(445 b)-cat, pfim(239 b)-cat and pfim(151 b)-cat fusions, indicating that all cis-elements are located within the 151-base region.
As pfim(445 b)-cat fusion contains the longest 5' flanking region of pfim, this fusion was used as the full-length pfim control in the following analysis.
Elevated CAT activities were detected in both the wild-type FW213 and DeltafimR harboring the pfim(109 b)-cat fusion, suggesting that the sequence between -151 and -109 contains a negative regulatory element.
Further shortening the length of pfim by 50 bases (pfim[59 b]-cat) reduced the CAT expression, suggesting that the sequence from -109 to -59 is essential for optimal expression.
Trans-complementation of fimR on pDL276 (pHR6) in strain DeltafimR harboring pfim(445 b)-cat restored wild-type pfim expression (Figure S1).
Taken together, pfim is negatively regulated by FimR.
The different expression levels in DeltafimR harboring various fusions also suggest the presence of additional regulators.



The Expression of pfim was Modulated by both Mn2+ and Fe2+

Previous studies by Oetjen et al. demonstrated that fimCBA encodes an uptake system for manganese and iron [5].
However, the expression of the fim operon is repressed only by Mn2+ but not Fe3+.
To investigate whether Fe2+ is involved in the FimR-mediated regulation, the CAT activity in the wild-type FW213 and DeltafimR in the presence of various amounts of Mn2+ and Fe2+ was determined (Figure 3).
To precisely control the content of the metal ions, cells were cultivated in the chemically-defined medium FMC supplemented with various amounts of metal ions as detailed in the materials and methods.
As expected, an up regulation of pfim expression was consistently observed in DeltafimR under all conditions used, confirming the negative effect of FimR on pfim expression.
With 50 microM of Mn2+ and/or Fe2+, the pfim activity in DeltafimR was approximately twofold higher than that in the wild-type strain, and comparable expression levels were detected among the three conditions (Figure 3, lanes II to IV), indicating that FimR is active in the presence of Mn2+ or Fe2+.
However, when cells were grown under limited Mn2+ (0.01 microM) and Fe2+ (0.1 microM), a further up regulation was observed in both the wild-type and DeltafimR hosts (Figure 3, lane I), suggesting that additional regulation modulated by the amounts of Mn2+ and Fe2+ also participates in the regulation.
To confirm that the observed differential expression in response to Mn2+ and Fe2+ was driven by the promoter but not the nature of CAT, we also monitored the activity of pfap1, whose expression is insensitive to Mn2+ and/or Fe2+ contents, under various metal conditions by using a S. parasanguinis pfap1-cat fusion stain.
A comparable CAT activity was observed in this strain under all four metal conditions (Figure S2), confirming the regulation of pfim in response to metal conditions.



FimR Binds to pfim Directly

As the predicted FimR binding site overlaps with -35 and -10 elements of pfim, the reporter assay described above does not allow us to analyze directly the impact of this region in pfim expression.
Thus, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was used to determine if FimR directly interacts with pfim.
A biotin-labeled DNA fragment containing both inverted repeats 5' to the +1 of pfim (Figure 2A) was incubated with increasing amounts of purified histidine-tagged FimR (His-FimR) in the presence Mn2+.
Two probe-FimR complexes were evident with 40 microM His-FimR, and the complexes with the slower mobility become clear in the reaction with 80 microM His-FimR (Figure 4).
The shift pattern remained the same in the presence of additional unlabelled tcrB fragment, indicating that FimR binds specifically to the pfim probe.
This result also suggests the presence of two FimR binding sites on the probe.

To confirm the in vivo binding of FimR to pfim, and to determine the impact of Mn2+ and Fe2+ on the binding activity of FimR, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay-quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) with anti-FimR antibody was employed as detailed in the materials and methods.
The strongest binding of FimR to pfim was detected in cells grown in the presence of 50 microM MnCl2 and 50 microM FeSO4 (Figure 5, lane IV), whereas minimal amounts of MnCl2 (0.01 microM) and FeSO4 (0.1 microM) led to the weakest binding (Figure 5, lane I).
Although both Fe2+ and Mn2+ at 50 microM can activate FimR, an 1.8-fold increase in the relative quantity was observed when 50 microM Mn2+ was provided in the culture medium compared to medium containing 50 microM Fe2+ (Figure 5, lanes II and III), indicating that Mn2+ is more effective than Fe2+ for FimR activation.
Taken together, in the presence of excess amounts of Mn2+ or Fe2+, FimR repressed the expression of pfim by directly binding to the target sequence.



FimA is Required for S. parasanguinis Defense against Oxidative Stress

As intracellular metal homeostasis is linked closely to the oxidative stress response, the possible role of FimA and FimR regulation in avoiding oxidative challenge was examined.
Generally, regulatory proteins of DtxR family modulate not only metal homeostasis but also the expression of other genes, thus a fimA and fimR double mutant strain (VT930_DeltafimR) was also included in the following studies to differentiate the impact of fimA and other genes regulated by FimR.
The growth of all strains in the presence of paraquat, a redox-cycling compound that can cause oxidative stress by generating superoxide radical in the cytoplasm, was monitored.
It was noticed that inactivation of fimA (VT930) [31] or both fimA and fimR (VT930_DeltafimR) enhanced the growth in TH broth, whereas fimR-deficiency alone (DeltafimR) led to a longer doubling time than the wild-type strain (Figure 6A).
The estimated doubling time for the wild-type FW213, VT930, DeltafimR and VT930_DeltafimR in TH is 80, 50, 105 and 50 min, respectively.
In the presence of 2 mM paraquat, a reduced growth rate was detected in both the wild-type FW213 and DeltafimR.
The lag phase in DeltafimR was slightly shorter than that in the wild-type strain in the presence of 2 mM paraquat (Figure 6B), and the difference between these two strains was more pronounced under 4 mM paraquat (Figure 6C).
On the other hand, the growth of VT930 and VT930_DeltafimR was severely hampered in the presence of paraquat.
Thus, a functional FimCBA transport system is essential for optimal oxidative stress responses in S. parasanguinis.
As VT930 and VT930_DeltafimR bear a similar capacity against paraquat challenge, it is concluded that the expression of fimA plays a key role in this process.



FimA Enhances the Intracellular Survival of S. parasanguinis within Macrophages

Macrophages are critical for defending microbial infection, thus the impact of FimA and FimR regulation in the survival of S. parasanguinis within macrophages was analyzed.
Of note, inactivation of fimA does not inhibit the uptake of the bacteria by granulocytes [6].
The intracellular survival rate of VT930 and VT930_DeltafimR within THP1 was less than 50% of that of wild-type FW213, whereas the survival rate of DeltafimR was twofold greater than that of wild-type FW213 (Figure 7A).
A similar survival pattern between wild-type FW213, VT930, DeltafimR and VT930_DeltafimR was detected in RAW264.7 macrophages (Figure 7B).
As the expression of fim operon was negatively regulated by FimR, and VT930 and VT930_DeltafimR exhibited a comparable survival rate in both macrophages used, these results indicated that the expression of FimA is critical for wild-type levels of survival within macrophages.



The Expression of the fim Operon is not Required for the Acid Tolerance of S. parasanguinis

As oxidative stress responses are known to overlap with acid tolerance [32] - [35], the possible function of FimA and FimR in acid tolerance was determined by an acid killing assay.
When the survival rates at pH 3 was examined, a time-dependent decline in survival rate was observed with all strains tested.
Interestingly, the viability of DeltafimR was lower than that of the wild-type FW213, whereas inactivation of fimA or both fimA and fimR enhanced the survival at pH 3 (Figure 8).
These results indicated that, opposite to the oxidative stress responses, S. parasanguinis was more sensitive to acidic challenges when the fim operon was highly expressed.
