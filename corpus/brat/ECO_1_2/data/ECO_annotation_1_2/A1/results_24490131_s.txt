Cloning, expression and purification of WalR, WalKc, WalKc(PH) and WalKc(H)

WalR is the full length RR, while WalKc (consisting of HAMP, PAS, DHp and CA domains) is the complete cytoplasmic portion of the HK WalK.
WalKc(PH) (consisting of PAS, DHp and CA domains) and WalKc(H) (consisting of DHp and CA domains) are two domain deletion variants of WalKc (Fig. 1).
All the ORFs were cloned in the expression vector pET28a+ that adds a hexa-histidine tag to their C-terminus.
The proteins were overexpressed and purified using Ni+2 - NTA affinity chromatography.
The histidine-tagged purified proteins were analyzed using SDS - PAGE.
The expressed recombinant proteins ran at molecular weight of ~30 kDa for WalR (migrating slightly higher than its expected size of ~28 kDa), ~48 kDa for WalKc, ~44 kDa for WalKc(PH) and ~28 kDa for WalKc(H) (Fig. S1).



In vivo expression of walR and walK

Quantitative real time PCR: qRT-PCR was done to analyze the growth stage specific expression of transcript levels of walR and walK in B. anthracis.
Four growth stages were chosen according to the growth curve of B. anthracis Sterne strain-early exponential (O.D.600nm ~0.3), mid exponential (O.D.600nm ~0.6), late exponential (O.D.600nm ~0.9) and onset of stationary phase (O.D.600nm ~1.2).
The mRNAs for both the genes could be detected throughout the growth period, indicating that the genes are transcribed throughout the phases (Fig. 2A).
After the transcript levels, expression at the protein level was also checked using immunoblotting.

Immunoblotting: The endogenous protein expression was also validated by immunoblotting of the soluble/cytoplasmic and cell wall plus membrane subcellular fractions of B. anthracis.
WalR was found to be expressed throughout the growth period, as detected in the soluble fractions of B. anthracis at different growth stages.
A single specific band at the expected size was observed for WalR (~30 kDa) and the specificity of the band was confirmed using recombinant WalR as the control (Fig. 2B).
Both the recombinant and native WalR migrated to nearly the same distance because there was only 1 kDa difference in their molecular weights.
In case of WalK, no specific band could be detected on probing with anti-WalKc antisera (data not shown).
This could be due to very low amount of WalK in the respective fractions.

The endogenous protein expression and localization for WalR and WalK was also checked using confocal immunofluorescence microscopy.
WalR could be localized to the cytoplasm of B. anthracis but WalK could not be detected once again (data not shown).
Though the expression of walR and walK could be observed throughout the exponential and stationary stages, this does not necessarily indicate its constitutive activation.
It is the phosphorylation of any HK and RR that governs its activity.
A true picture of the activity of any TCS can be drawn by an assessment of the transcript levels of the gene candidates that it can specifically regulate.



Autophosphorylation of WalK variants and phosphotransfer to WalR

The primary catalytic function of a HK is autophosphorylation followed by phosphotransfer to its cognate RR.
Biochemical studies were done to test both these activities in WalKc and its variants.
When WalKc was incubated with labeled ATP mixture, autophosphorylation could be detected as early as 5 min post ATP addition and activity increased with time, reaching a maximum in 60 min (Lane 2 & 5, Fig. 3A).
When WalKc and WalR were incubated together, autophosphorylation of WalKc and phosphotranfer to WalR could be observed after addition of labeled ATP mixture.
Phosphotransfer also could be detected within 5 min of incubation that increased with time of incubation and reached maximum level in 60 min (Lane 1 & 4, Fig. 4A), indicating WalKc and WalR form a functional HK-RR pair in vitro.

WalKc, after purification, partly degraded into a lower molecular weight protein which tested positive in immunoblotting and autophosphorylation.
This issue was resolved by removing the HAMP linker from WalKc resulting in WalKc(PH).
WalKc(PH) harboring PAS, DHp and CA domains, and WalKc(H) comprising of DHp and CA domains were also tested for autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer to WalR.
Both, WalKc(PH) and WalKc(H), appeared to be more efficient than WalKc in autophosphorylation.
The detectable levels of phosphorylation within the first 10 min of incubation with labeled ATP mixture were higher for WalKc(PH) and WalKc(H) than for WalKc (Lane 3, Fig. 3A - C).
Phosphotransfer could also be observed in both the cases indicating that both, WalKc(PH) and WalKc(H), are functionally active and competent for phosphotransfer to WalR (Fig. 4).



Phosphorylation of WalR by small molecule phosphoryl donors

Low molecular weight phosphoryl donors like acetyl phosphate, carbamoyl phosphate and phosphoramidate have been shown to phosphorylate some RRs [32,33].
We tested whether acetyl phosphate and carbamoyl phosphate could phosphorylate WalR in vitro.
When WalR was incubated with acetyl phosphate, it was observed that only 20 - 25% of WalR was phosphorylated under the conditions tested (Fig. 5A).
The phosphorylated form was stable at 37 degrees C for 60 min.
Acetyl phosphate mediated phosphorylation has not been checked for B. subtilis WalR (WalRBsu), but a similar observation was made with a related RR- PhoPBsu [34] which has 83% similarity (62% identity) with B. anthracis WalR (WalRBan) in the receiver domain.

The stability of WalR~P was tested under acidic (0.5 N HCl) and basic (0.5 N NaOH) conditions to analyze the properties of the residue that has undergone phosphorylation in WalR.
The acetyl phosphate mediated phosphorylation of WalR was acid stable, base labile (Fig. 5B) and required Mg+2 ions, displaying characteristics of a phospho-aspartate bond in RRs as generated by the cognate kinase [34].
Carbamoyl phosphate mediated phosphorylation of WalR was also found to be inefficient, reaching 25 - 30% only in 60 min (data not shown), suggesting small molecule phosphoryl donors may not act as efficient substrates for WalR phosphotransfer activity.



WalKc variants mediated dephosphorylation of WalR~P

The domain organization for WalK is shown in Fig. 1.
WalK HK possesses a DHp domain which belongs to HisKA subfamily [35].
The HisKA family, which is the largest subfamily of bacterial DHp domains, bears an E/DxxT/N motif which has been implicated in phosphatase activity [36,37].
The T/N residue of this motif (hydroxyl/amide group) is critical for coordinating a nucleophilic water molecule for an inline attack on RR~P resulting in hydrolysis of the phospho-aspartate bond [36,37].
A similar motif was found in the DHp domain of WalK just next to phosphorylatable histidine (Fig. 6).
This observation led us to test WalKc variants for their phosphatase activity.

The WalR~P obtained after phosphorylation of WalR by acetyl phosphate was used to assay the phosphatase activity of WalKc(PH) and WalKc(H).
Both WalKc(PH) and WalKc(H) could cause loss of phosphate from WalR~P (Lane 3, 4, 9 - 12, Fig. 7A).
However, WalKc(H) appeared to be more robust than WalKc(PH) in phosphatase activity as is indicated by the residual WalR~P levels after 10 min of incubation (Lane 3 & 5, Fig. 7B and C).
This indicated that it is the DHp and/or CA domains which are the essential element for phosphatase activity.
DHp domains alone have been seen to exhibit phosphatase activity in HKs [38].
To test the same, DHp domain of WalK was cloned.
However, it could not be expressed under the same conditions which were tested for other WalK variants in the study.
No other condition was tested for DHp expression.
Hence, WalK possesses both the kinase and phosphatase activity, thereby, adding it to the growing list of bifunctional HKs of TCS.



Identification of putative WalR regulon in B. anthracis genome

The WalR RR of B. anthracis shares 79% identity with its ortholog in B. subtilis in the primary amino acid sequence.
Their C-terminal DNA binding domains exhibit a significant 93% amino acid identity.
Such a high level of identity indicates that the two domains may have a similar structure and recognize similar DNA sequence.
Therefore, the consensus WalR DNA binding sequence was expected to be similar to that obtained from B. subtilis [39].
Using the methodology described, a total of 33 prospective WalR binding sites were found, on both the strands, corresponding to upstream regions of 30 genes (Table 1) that could form a potential WalR regulon.
Domain annotation and broad functional prediction was carried out for the candidate genes and those with significant predicted functions were shortlisted for further DNA binding studies.
Of the 30 hits, only five were annotated for their function in the Uniprot database (eag, ftsE, kinB3, phoX and hppD).
The eag gene codes for an S-layer protein Extractable Antigen 1 (EA1), ftsE codes for a cell division ABC transporter and kinB3 codes for a sporulation histidine kinase (Table 2).
Structure function annotation of the deduced genes having WalR binding site in the upstream region using the conserved domain database and COG database, is given in Table 1.
None of the classical virulence factors of B. anthracis appeared to be regulated by WalR, in contrast to what has been observed in related pathogens S. aureus and S. pneumoniae [14,26,29].
By COG categorization, 9 genes from the total of 30 were predicted to be implicated in transport and metabolism, while 2 were hydrolases and 1 was a member of Major Facilitator Superfamily.
This reflects that WalRK may control a diverse set of functions in B. anthracis, but direct regulation of virulence is not indicated.



DNA binding ability of WalR

RRs mostly function as transcription factors.
WalR belongs to the OmpR family of RRs on the basis of its C-terminal domain sequence which contains a winged helix-turn-helix DNA binding motif.
To test if WalR could bind to DNA, increasing amounts of purified WalR was incubated with probes from eag, ftsE and kinB3 upstream regions, which contained the WalR binding site, in the presence of an excess of non-specific competitor DNA poly (dI-dC).
The incubation of WalR with eag, ftsE and kinB3 probes resulted in formation of higher molecular weight DNA-protein complexes while WalR did not cause a comparable shift with a control probe lacking the binding site (Fig. 8).
This shows that WalR can bind to the upstream regions of eag, ftsE and kinB3 in vitro in a sequence dependent manner, indicating that they can be a probable part of WalR regulon.
