Effect of hns and slyA mutations on chromosomal hlyE - lacZ expression in vivo

The level of hlyE expression is increased in an E. coli hns mutant (Westermark et al., 2000; Wyborn et al., 2004b).
Expression of hlyE - lacZ carried on a multicopy plasmid is enhanced by introduction of multicopy slyA in a parent strain but not in an hns mutant, suggesting that SlyA has no intrinsic activator role, but that it probably relieves H-NS-mediated repression of hlyE transcription (Wyborn et al., 2004b).
To discount the possibility that previous results were affected by plasmid copy number and regulator titration the effects of hns and slyA mutations on expression of a chromosomal hlyE - lacZ fusion were determined (Table 1).
Aerobic cultures supplemented with 0.2% glucose were used to minimize the activities of FNR and CRP proteins.
At 20 degrees C, beta-galactosidase activity of the hns mutant cultures was 1.8-fold higher than of the cultures of the parent strain, confirming the repressive effect of H-NS on hlyE - lacZ expression.
Expression of hlyE in a slyA mutant was reduced to 60% of that of the parent, demonstrating a positive effect of slyA in the presence of functional hns gene.
In the hns slyA double mutant, hlyE expression was twofold greater than in the parent, and slightly higher than the hns single mutant, suggesting that slyA has a small negative effect on hlyE expressionin the absence of H-NS.
At 37 degrees C, hlyE - lacZ expression was ~25% lower than that observed at 20 degrees C for theparental, hns, and hns slyA strains (Table 1).
However, expression of hlyE in the slyA mutant was similar at both temperatures.
These data support the hypothesis that SlyA relieves H-NS-mediated repression of hlyE expression.



SlyA binds at two separate sites at the hlyE promoter and inhibits H-NS binding

Previous in vitro DNase I protection analysis with PhlyE identified a SlyA footprint from -70 to -30 relative to the hlyE transcription start site, reflecting the presence of two separate palindromic SlyA-recognition sequences in this upstream region, these being SlyA Ia (-61TTATCATATTAA-50) and SlyA Ib (-50ATAGAAATAAAG-39) (consensus-matching bases in bold) (Wyborn et al., 2004b).
In this work, using a PhlyE DNA fragment extending from -171 to +222, we have observed another SlyA binding site (named SlyA II) in the region downstream of the transcript start site.
In the presence of SlyA, protection of PhlyE was observed from -70 to -30 (corresponding to the previously described SlyA I site) and also in the region downstream of the transcript start site from +34 to +109 (Fig. 1).
The crystal structures of E. coli MarR and Enterococcus faecalis SlyA-like proteins show their cross-sections are ~70 angstroms, suggesting they would protect ~20 bp of DNA (Alekshun et al., 2001; Wu et al., 2003).
This suggests the presence of two SlyA dimers at the SlyA I site and at least three dimers at the SlyA II site.
The downstream site, SlyA II, was protected in the presence of SlyA at concentrations of 0.3 muM and above, whereas the SlyA I site was only partially protected in the presence of 0.6 muM and fully protected with 1.2 muM SlyA (Fig. 1), suggesting that the SlyA protein has a higher affinity for the SlyA II site.

Wyborn et al. (2004b) described two regions of H-NS binding at the PhlyE using 1 muM H-NS which extended from -75 to -37 (H-NS I) and from -22 to +11 (H-NS II).
At higher concentrations up to 9.6 muM, H-NS was shown to interact with a larger region of PhlyE extending from -137 to +182 (Westermark et al., 2000).
Taken together these data suggested that at lower concentrations H-NS may bind at AT-rich specific nucleation sites, and at higher concentrations, multiple H-NS proteins oligomerize to occupy both the upstream and downstream regions of PhlyE.
To test the hypothesis that SlyA can modulate the interaction of H-NS with PhlyE, footprinting analysis was performed using combinations of H-NS and SlyA protein.

Using 2.4 muM H-NS, regions of PhlyE protection were observed from -70 to -30 [corresponding to the H-NS I site found by Wyborn et al. (2004b)], -16 to -9, and -7 to +40 (corresponding approximately to the H-NS II site) (Fig. 2, lane 3).
The H-NS footprint was also characterized by hypersensitive bases at -30, -17 and -8.
With 2 muM SlyA, protection was observed at -70 to -38 (SlyA I) and from +35 to beyond the end of the autoradiographs (SlyA II), with a hypersensitive region from -30 to -9 (Fig. 2, lane 4).
In reactions where 0.1 muM H-NS was added to the SlyA:PhlyE complex, both SlyA I and II sites remained protected (Fig. 2, lane 5).
On addition of 1.2 muM H-NS, protection of the SlyA I and II sites was abolished, and replaced by weak protection of the H-NS II site, but no apparent protection of H-NS I (Fig. 2, lane 6).
Furthermore, the pattern of hypersensitive bases from -30 to -9 remained, suggesting that the addition of 1.2 muM H-NS allowed some SlyA to associate with the complex, and that H-NS was unable to fully interact with PhlyE.
In reactions where 2.4 or 3.6 muM H-NS were added, the pattern of protection observed resembled the footprint made by the H-NS protein alone, with protection at both H-NS I and II sites (Fig. 2, lanes 7 and 8).

In reactions where 0.1 muM SlyA was added to PhlyE before addition of 2.5 muM H-NS (Fig. 3, lane 5), the resulting footprint resembled that produced by H-NS alone (Fig. 3, lane 3).
When 0.5 muM or 1 muM SlyA was added before H-NS, the pronounced H-NS footprint was absent, and hypersensitive sites were present at -91, -30, -16 (Fig. 3, lanes 6 and 7).
Therefore, in the presence of a high level of H-NS, addition of a low level of SlyA did not affect the binding of H-NS at PhlyE, but when the level of SlyA was increased, a unique pattern of protection was obtained which is distinct from, yet shares some features of, the footprints made by H-NS or SlyA alone.

Overall, the footprinting data suggested that a PhlyE:SlyA complex is formed when SlyA binds at specific sites in the upstream and downstream regions of the promoter, and when present at a high enough concentrations, SlyA prevents the binding of low levels of H-NS at the H-NS I and H-NS II sites.
At intermediate concentrations of H-NS, the pattern of protection and hypersensitive bases suggests that the structure of the PhlyE:SlyA complex is altered, but H-NS is unable to fully interact with PhlyE.
When H-NS is present at a higher concentration it can displace SlyA from SlyA sites I and II and thus occupy the H-NS I and II sites enabling the formation of higher-order H-NS complexes.



Interaction of SlyA, H-NS and RNAP at the hlyE promoter

It has been suggested that H-NS binding renders PhlyE inaccessible to RNAP (Westermark et al., 2000).
Whereas previous work analysed the interaction of either H-NS or SlyA with PhlyE, in this study electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were used to examine the interaction of mixtures of H-NS, SlyA and RNAP with PhlyE.

A SlyA:PhlyE complex with significantly retarded mobility was formed on addition of 1.25 muM SlyA to PhlyE DNA (Fig. 4A, lane 2).
Addition of up to 0.63 muM H-NS to this complex had no significant effect on the SlyA:PhlyE complex (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 - 5), but mobility was increased in the presence of 1.25 and 2.5 muM H-NS (Fig. 4A, lanes 6 and 7).
This increase in mobility in the presence of H-NS indicates the formation of a SlyA:H-NS:PhlyE complex (note that in comparison with SlyA:PhlyE, the H-NS:PhlyE complex migrates significantly further; Fig. 4B, lane 2).
In the reverse experiment, increasing amounts of SlyA were added to a complex of PhlyE and 1.25 muM H-NS.
The mobility of H-NS:PhlyE was not affected by addition of up to 0.63 muM SlyA (Fig. 4B, lanes 2 - 5), but was significantly altered after addition of 1.25 muM or 2.5 muM SlyA (Fig. 4B, lanes 6 and 7).
The simplest explanation for these data is that initial formation of a SlyA:PhlyE complex prevents binding of H-NS when H-NS is present at low concentrations.
When a critical concentration of H-NS is reached, a SlyA:H-NS:PhlyE complex forms with an altered structure, as indicated by the changes in the DNase I footprint and EMSA mobility.
The DNase I footprints (Fig. 2, lane 8) indicate that H-NS can ultimately displace SlyA.
However, when the SlyA concentration increases relative to that of H-NS, the H-NS:PhlyE complex is replaced by a SlyA:PhlyE complex via a SlyA:H-NS:PhlyE intermediate.
The switches between these different nucleoprotein complexes appear to occur over narrow concentration ranges, suggesting that at critical thresholds a 'see-saw' mechanism operates in which SlyA antagonizes H-NS interaction and H-NS antogonizes SlyA binding at PhlyE.

The effect of adding SlyA or H-NS to PhlyE in the presence of RNAP was then tested.
Addition of up to 2.5 muM SlyA did not affect the mobility of the RNAP:PhlyE complex (Fig. 4C, lanes 2 - 7).
Although it is not known at this stage whether both RNAP and SlyA are bound at PhlyE simultaneously, the mobility of a mixture of PhlyE, RNAP and SlyA was lower than SlyA:PhlyE alone (Fig. 4C, lanes 7 and 8), indicating that addition of SlyA did not interfere with the binding of RNAP to PhlyE.
However, the RNAP:PhlyE complex was severely affected by the addition of H-NS (Fig. 4D).
As the H-NS concentration was increased, the proportion of RNAP:PhlyE complex was reduced and the proportion of H-NS:PhlyE was increased (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 - 7), suggesting that H-NS replaces RNAP at PhlyE in a concentration-dependent manner.
Thus, the EMSA data supported the hypothesis that H-NS negatively regulates PhlyE by promoter occlusion.
In contrast, SlyA did not prevent RNAP binding at PhlyE, but did inhibit H-NS binding.



SlyA relieves H-NS-dependent repression of hlyE transcription in vitro

The footprinting and EMSA data show that different nucleoprotein complexes are formed at PhlyE depending on the relative concentrations of H-NS and SlyA through competition for overlapping binding sites upstream and downstream of the hlyE transcript start site.
This suggested a regulatory mechanism whereby increased intracellular concentrations of SlyA remodel H-NS binding at PhlyE to relieve H-NS-mediated repression by allowing RNAP to access the promoter.
Plasmid pGS1886 contains the PhlyE and the 5'-end of the hlyE gene extending from -474 to +222 relative to the transcript start site.
It was predicted that addition of H-NS would repress production of hlyE mRNA in an in vitro transcription reaction using pGS1886, and that addition of SlyA would modulate the effect of H-NS and allow hlyE transcription.
At 25 degrees C RNAP-induced expression of a hlyE transcript of 222 nt (Fig. 5A, lane 1) was abolished when 0.5 muM H-NS was added to the reaction (Fig. 5A, lane 5).
In a mixture of RNAP and 0.5 muM H-NS supplemented with 1 muM or 12 muM SlyA, the hlyE transcript was still repressed at 25 degrees C (Fig. 5A, lanes 7 and 8).
However, at 37 degrees C, addition of 1 muM or 12 muM SlyA partially relieved the repression caused by the presence of 0.5 muM H-NS (Fig. 5B, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 7 and 8).
Although reproducible, the enhancement in the abundance of the hlyE transcript when SlyA was added to the PhlyE:H-NS complex was somewhat disappointing under the conditions used for the experiments in Fig. 5A and B.
Using an equivalent supercoiled template in place of the linearized DNA used for the experiments in Fig. 5A and B failed to improve SlyA-mediated inhibition of SlyA repression under the same conditions (not shown).
However, a greater effect was observed when a PCR product (-474 to +222 relative to the hlyE transcript start) that contained both PhlyE and the promoter of the divergently transcribed umuD gene was used in the in vitro transcription reactions.
Addition of 2 muM H-NS repressed both hlyE and umuD transcription (Fig. 5C).
Therefore, 2 muM H-NS was used in SlyA titration experiments.
At low SlyA:H-NS ratios both PhlyE and PumuD were still repressed (Fig. 5D, lanes 2 and 3).
However, at a higher concentration of SlyA, transcription of hlyE was specifically restored (Fig. 5D, lane 4).
In contrast to PhlyE, umuD was repressed whenever H-NS was present, showing that SlyA specifically antagonizes H-NS repression of PhlyE.
