Direct targets of PhoP

The comparison of mRNA profile of the WT Y. pestis with that of the phoP null mutant under the Mg2+-limiting condition [16] identified an array of 706 PhoP-dependent genes.
This analysis had the difficulty in distinguishing between direct targets and indirect ones of PhoP.
In the present study, the following genes (87 genes in total) were picked out from the above 706 ones for EMSA: i) those responsible for stress-adaptive or regulatory function; and ii) those with a homologue of E. coli PhoP box sequence in their promoter-proximal regions (with a cutoff of 2 bp mismatch).
The EMSA was conducted to test the binding of His-PhoP to the 400 to 500 bp region upstream of the translation start site for each gene.
Accordingly, a total of 30 transcription units gave the stable, positive results of EMSA (Table 2 and Additional file 3).
To ensure the specificity of EMSA, two additional genes (purK and atpG) were included as negative controls.
For selection of them as negative controls, the patser-matrix tool [21] was employed to match the PhoP matrix (see below) within their promoter regions, and both of them gave a very low value of weight score (a greater number of this score corresponds to a higher probability of presence of a PhoP-binding site).

1 The gene IDs were derived from the genome annotation of Y. pestis CO92.
Putative transcription units (30 in total) were boxed, and the vertical arrows indicated the transcriptional organization.

2 The mRNA expression in the phoP null mutant was compared with that in the WT strain grown under low Mg2+ condition.

3 The data were present as the mean change of mRNA level for each gene under the paired growth conditions.
The positive number stood for fold increased, while minus decreased.

4 There was the discrepancy between the data determined by RT-PCR and microarray (a total of three genes); the subsequent primer extension assay verified the rationality of the RT-PCR results.

5'ND' indicated 'not done'.

The microarray analysis was able to semi-quantitatively identify genes under either positive or negative control by PhoP.
However, microarray results are influenced by various factors, and thereby should be validated by at least one traditional method [24].
Accordingly, the real-time quantitative RT-PCR, using the same RNA preparations as the microarray analysis, was performed to validate the microarray data in Additional file 2.
Except for three genes (metJ, fruR and astC), RT-PCR and microarray data showed a good agreement.
Since RT-PCR and microarray gave the contradictory results for the above three genes, the further primer extension assay (Additional file 4) was conducted by using the same RNA preparations, which showed the creditability of the RT-PCR data (Additional file 2 and Additional file 5).
Thereby, the positive or negative regulation of each selected gene by the PhoP was elucidated as shown in Additional file 2.

Taken together, we identified a total of 30 transcription units whose transcription was PhoP-dependent in response to Mg2+ limitation, and these units should be the direct PhoP targets.



Transcription start sites of direct PhoP targets

In addition to the above three genes (metJ, fruR and astC), we still performed the primer extension assay on another 15 genes (Additional file 4).
These genes encoded either stress-adaptive or regulatory functions.
A single primer extension product was detected for 12 of them.
Two or more primer extension products were detected for katA, uspB, pmrE, oppA,phoP and slyA.
Since the shorter extension products might represent the premature stops due to difficulties of polymerase in passing difficult sequences, only the longest product was chosen for the identification of each gene's transcription start site.

Accordingly, a transcription start site was identified for each of the above 18 genes, indicating a PhoP-dependent promoter was transcribed for each of them.
The nucleotide number of each transcription start site was taken as '+1', and accordingly the promoter -10 and -35 elements for RNA polymerase(RNAP) recognition were predicted (see below).



The PhoP-binding sites

To precisely determine the PhoP-binding sites of target genes, DNase I footprinting assay was performed on 17 PhoP-dependent promoter DNA regions (both coding and noncoding strands) (Additional file 6).
DNase I footprinting results confirmed the direct binding of His-PhoP to these promoter regions in vitro.
For each DNA fragment tested, His-PhoP protected at least one distinct region against DNase I digestion in a dose-dependent pattern.
The size of footprint ranged from 25 to 62 bases with an average of 35 bases.
These footprint regions were considered as the PhoP-binding sites.
Interestingly, the phoP promoter region had two separated PhoP binding sites, while sodB had three (Additional file 6).
Additionally, the uspA and uspB genes shared a single PhoP binding site (see below).
In total, 19 PhoP-binding sites were detected for the 17 PhoP-regulated genes analyzed.

The His tag fused in the recombinant PhoP protein is positively charged, while DNA probe in the footprinting experiments is negatively charged.
One may argue that there would be the possibility of nonspecific binding between His tag and DNA probe.
Accordingly, the PCR-generated upstream DNA fragments of two genes sodC and oppA were employed as negative controls (Additional file 7).
The DNA probes used here did not harbor the predicted PhoP box, compared with the corresponding ones in Additional file 6.
No His-PhoP protected region was detected for the DNA probes tested, indicating the specificity of DNase I footprinting experiments.



The PhoP regulatory motif in Y. pestis

Matching of the E. coli PhoP box within the above 19 PhoP binding sites (both coding and noncoding strands) revealed the tandem direct repeat in each of them.
Then, an 18 bp footprint sequence covering each detecting regulatory motif was picked out for the alignment as shown in Figure 1(a).
A sequence logo of the aligned direct repeats was given in Figure 1(b).
In addition, position count matrix was built as shown in Figure 1(c), so as to statistically describe the alignment of the direct repeat elements.
Finally, an 18 bp PhoP box sequence (TGTTTAWN4TGTTTAW) in Figure 1(d) was deduced from the sequence logo, which was very similar to those of E. coli and S. enterica.



Organization of PhoP-dependent promoters

As described above, we mapped PhoP-binding sites and transcription start sites within a collection of 17 PhoP-dependent promoters.
These data enabled us to depict the organization of PhoP-dependent promoters (Figure 2) which gave a map of PhoP-DNA interaction within each promoter.
For each target gene, translation/transcription start sites, promoter -10 and -35 elements, PhoP-binding sites, and PhoP box sequence were shown together.

The products of uspA and uspB belong to the UspA family proteins with roles in defense against DNA damage.
These two adjacent genes are transcribed with opposite direction in Y. pestis [25] and activated by PhoP (Additional file 2).
DNase I footprinting identified a single PhoP-protected region for both coding and noncoding strands of their intergenic region (36 and 35 bp, respectively) (Figure 3).
These two footprint sequences overlapped 34 bp, and a sequence resembling the PhoP box was found within this region.
Thus, these two genes share a single PhoP-binding site to mediate their transcriptional activation in low Mg2+ milieu.
