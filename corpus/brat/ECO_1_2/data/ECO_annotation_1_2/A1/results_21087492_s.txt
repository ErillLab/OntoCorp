The AGAA-motif within the xyn2 promoter is bound under glucose-repressing conditions

In vivo genomic footprinting data indicate that the transcriptional regulation of xyn2 expression involves the following cis-acting elements: a CCAAT-box, two Xyr1-binding motifs (GGGTAA and GGCTGG) known to bind Xyr1 (Xylanase regulator 1, [14]), and an AGAA-box [18,22].
Figure 1 summarizes the architecture of the xyn2 promoter.
The AGAA-box, as well as the CCAAT-box and one Xyr1-binding motif, are located on the antisense strand.
The AGAA tetranucleotide is fully protected under non-inducing conditions [22].
Cell-free extract protein from H. jecorina transferred to repressing (glucose) or inducing (xylan) conditions was subjected to an EMSA using radiolabeled probes.
A protein-DNA complex was readily observed using cell-free extract obtained under repressing conditions and a short oligonucleotide containing the AGAA-box (Pxyn2a, see Table 1) (Figure 1).
No protein-DNA interaction was detected when cell-free extracts from inducing conditions were used (Figure 1), supporting the idea that this part of the promoter is involved in repression.
If the AGAA sequence is mutated CTCC (Pxyn2aM, see Table 1), no DNA-protein complex is formed under either repressing or inducing conditions (Figure 1).
This result indicates that this part of the xyn2 promoter is essential for binding a transcription factor under repressing conditions.



Streptavidin-based isolation and identification of AGAA-binding proteins

The DNA-protein complex observed in the EMSA includes a putative repressor of xyn2 transcription (termed "Xpp1", Xylanase promoter-binding protein 1).
To isolate this complex, the same batch of cell-free extracts from H. jecorina transferred to glucose was subjected to affinity chromatography.
A schematic of the procedure is shown in Figure 2.
Biotinylated versions of the same oligonucleotides used for the EMSA (Bxyn2p250, see Table 1) were incubated on ice with streptavidin beads (Figure 2).
Under the EMSA reaction conditions, this mixture was incubated with the cell-free extract, which should include Xpp1 (Figure 2).
After magnetic separation, the whole eluate was subjected to Nano-HPLC separation.
The eluted peptides were monitored on the HPLC at a wavelength of 214 nm and directly applied to the mass spectrometer.

The tandem mass spectra were analyzed in silico as described above.
81 eluted proteins (see additional file 1) were identified and analyzed further with FGENESH V1 and GENEWISE 1.
Three proteins with DNA-binding domains were identified and represent potential transcription factors (Table 2).
These proteins (scan number 2488 (protein ID 122879), 3151 (protein ID 21557), 7236 (protein ID 108909)) were investigated in more detail and are hereafter referred to as "2488prp" (prp, promotor-binding protein), "3151prp", and "7236prp".
The mass spectra for these three selected candidate genes are available online at: http://cores.imba.oeaw.ac.at/index.php?id=3731.

To verify that the genes encoding 2488prp, 3151prp, and 7236prp correspond to transcripts in H. jecorina, we performed RT-PCR using cDNAs obtained under inducing and non-inducing conditions.
Using the primers listed in Table 1, we could clearly detect transcripts for the genes 2488prp, 3151prp, and 7236prp (Table 2).



Cloning, expression, and binding of putative AGAA-binding transcription factors of H. jecorina

Since transcripts for all three genes encoding the putative regulatory proteins were detected, the respective DNA-binding domains (DBD) were cloned and expressed as GST-fusion proteins using the pGEX-4T-2 vector and E. coli BL21-Gold.
Production of the recombinant proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A).
All clones, two for the expression of the 3151prp DBD, three for the expression of the 7236prp DBD, and two for the expression of the 2488prp DBD, produced proteins of expected sizes (34 kD for 3151prp, 36 kD for 7236prp, and 32 kD for 2488prp).
Two clones expressing GST alone were applied as controls and also produced bands of the correct size (26 kD).

The thrombin-cleaved DBD constructs were analyzed with an EMSA using an oligonucleotide covering the whole xyn2 promoter (Lpxyn2, see Table 1) or an oligonucleotide bearing the AGAA-box mutated to CTCC (Lpxyn2 M, see Table 1).
FAM-labelled probes seem to demand longer probes: a FAM-labelled (shorter) Pxyn2a only gave a weak shift (data not shown).
No shift was observed with the GST control or the 3151prp DBD (Figure 3B).
The 7236prp DBD yielded two protein-DNA complexes, but these are rather non-specific, as they also formed with the mutated probe (Figure 3B).
In contrast, the 2488prp DBD produced one slow-migrating shift that was not observed with the mutated probe (Figure 3B), indicating the formation of an AGAA-box specific DNA-protein complex.
This candidate was analyzed in more detail.



The binding of 2488prp to the xyn2 promoter of H. jecorina

Because 2488prp DBD produced an AGAA-box specific shift in the EMSA (Figure 3B), the corresponding gene was subjected to in vitro translation.
The accumulation of product from the in vitro translation was confirmed with SDS-PAGE of the FluoroTect (TM) Green-labelled proteins (Figure 4A).
A negative control reaction containing no DNA template produced no specific protein, but a positive control reaction containing a plasmid that codes for luciferase gave a protein band of the correct size (61 kD) (Figure 4A).
Using the plasmid pMPF2488 as template in an in vitro translation experiment was also found to yield a protein band of the expected size (54 kD) (Figure 4A).
Background bands of 42 kD (rabbit reticulocyte lysate protein) and 18 - 25 kD (aminoacyl tRNAs) are associated with the in vitro translation procedure (see manufacturer's guidelines).
We then performed an EMSA using the in vitro translated, unlabelled 2488prp and the labelled oligonucleotides (the same as for the EMSA with DBD).
No DNA-protein complex formed with the mutated probe (Lpxyn2 M, see Table 1) (Figure 4B), but one specific shift was observed with the probe lacking mutations (Lpxyn2) (Figure 4B, indicated by an arrow).
This shifted band migrated more slowly than the positive control shifted band using in vitro translated Xyr1 (Figure 4B, also indicated by an arrow).
Xyr1, a general hydrolase activating transcription factor in H. jecorina [14], was recently reported to bind the xyn2 promoter [18], acting as a cis-acting element near the AGAA-box, which is also present on the applied oligonucleotide.
The two shifts with the fastest mobility in the reactions containing oligonucleotide Lpxyn2 and in vitro translated 2488prp or Xyr1 (Figure 4B) are background.
These shifts also appear if the in vitro translation mixture is given no DNA-template or the luciferase protein (data not shown).
Therefore, we conclude that 2488prp binds the AGAA-box of the xyn2 promoter in vitro.



Characterisation of 2488prp

The putative 2488prp gene encodes a protein of 505 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 55 kD.
Sequence alignments indicate that the entire 2488prp protein has significant sequence similarity to hypothetical proteins in Nectria haematococca (GeneID: 9678588; 43%), Gibberella zeae (GeneID: 2791570; 43%), Neurospora crassa (GeneID: 3874038, 37%), Podospora anserina (GeneID: 6189947, 37%) Chaetomium globosum (GeneID: 4395593, 37%), Magnaporthe grisea (GeneID: 2675104, 36%).
The most similarity was found in the C-terminal part of the protein (compare additional file 2), which includes a helix-loop-helix domain (HLH-superfamily; [27]) with an overall length of 67 amino acids (aa 397 to 461).
A detailed domain analysis according to [28] revealed a basic DNA binding region (aa 397 to 406) N-terminal to two alpha-helices separated by a loop region (aa 409 to 461).
The basic N-terminal region is thought to mediate high-affinity DNA-binding [29], whereas the helix-loop-helix region functions as a dimerization interface [30].
A glutamic acid at position 404 strongly indicates that 2488prp belongs to the group of E-box binding HLH proteins (3).
The classical E-box is a hexameric palindrome.
Interestingly, the AGAA-box overlaps with a hexameric palindrome (TCTAGA on the sense strand).
Only the antisense part of this potential E-box has been reported to be protected according to in vivo footprinting experiments [18,22].
The sense strand cannot be analyzed because the sequence extension in the linker-mediated PCR is fully determined at the TATA-box (unpublished data, Wurleitner E. and Mach R.L.).



Transcription of 2488prp during cultivation in different carbon sources

In H. jecorina, the expression of the hydrolytic enzyme-encoding genes, such as xyn1, xyn2, bxl1, cbh1 (cellobiohydrolase 1), cbh2 (cellobiohydrolase 2), egl1 (endoglucanase 1), or bgl1 (beta-glucosidase 1), is regulated by the general activator Xyr1, regardless of the carbon source or inducing substance [14,31].
Nevertheless, different expression/induction patterns for these genes have been observed [17,22].
We examined, whether the transcription of this putative regulatory protein depends on the presence of certain induction signals or various carbon sources.

After pre-cultivation, the mycelium of H. jecorina was transferred to medium lacking a carbon source (de-repressing conditions) or to media containing 1% (w/v) glucose, glycerol (repressing conditions), D-xylose or xylan or 1.5 mM sophorose or xylobiose (inducing conditions).
Cultures were incubated for 3, 5, and 24 hours.
After RNA-extraction followed by cDNA synthesis, the transcript levels were analyzed via real-time PCR.

We observed that the abundance of the 2488prp transcript increases in the presence of carbon sources that repress hydrolase expression, such as glucose or glycerol, relative to de-repressing conditions (Fig 5A).
Similar observations were made when comparing inducing conditions, such as growth on D-xylose or xylan or in media containing xylobiose or sophorose, with transcript forming in media containing glucose (Figure 5B, C).
In all cases, it was clear that the transcription of the putative repressor 2488prp gene was downregulated.
These data strongly indicate that 2488prp transcription is upregulated under repressive conditions and that this protein functions as a repressor of hydrolase transcription.
