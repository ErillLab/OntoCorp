Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of a DeltaetrA::loxP mutant

The growth of the etrA knockout mutant EtrA7-1 with nitrate was significantly impaired as cultures reached a maximum OD600 of 0.02, at least 5-fold lower than the wild type strain (Figure 1).
In addition, the doubling time for the mutant under these conditions was approximately 10 h compared to a doubling time of 2 h for the wild type.
Plasmid pCCG03 carrying etrA, but not the parental pCM62 vector lacking etrA, restored near wild type growth to the EtrA7-1 mutant, which confirms that the observed phenotype was attributable to the deletion of etrA.
After 10 h of incubation, nitrate was reduced in wild type and complemented EtrA7-1 cultures though less nitrate was reduced in the latter consistent with its slightly slower growth (Figure 2).
After 23 h, both the wild type and EtrA7-1 complement had completely converted nitrate and nitrite to ammonia, while nitrite was the major product in cultures of the EtrA7-1 mutant and the control strain harboring pCM62 (Figure 2).

Anaerobic cultures of the mutant and the wild type strain were analyzed for the reduction of different electron acceptors with lactate as the electron donor.
No growth of the EtrA7-1 mutant was observed with fumarate as electron acceptor whereas the wild type strain reached an OD600 of 0.053 +- 0.005.
Limited growth (approximately 50% lower OD600 compared with the wild type cultures) was observed in mutant cultures amended with trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) or thiosulfate (data not shown).
No OD increases with the mutant and the wild type were measured with DMSO provided as electron acceptor at 2 and 10 mM; however, HPLC analyses of cultures with 2 mM DMSO revealed that DMSO was completely consumed in wild type cultures, whereas no DMSO consumption was evident in the mutant cultures (Figure 3).
No changes in DMSO concentrations were observed in cultures with 10 mM DMSO.
No significant differences in Fe(III), Mn(IV) and sulfite reduction rates were observed between the wild type and the EtrA7-1 deletion mutant (Figure 3).
Anaerobic cultures of the mutant and the wild type strains grown with pyruvate instead of lactate as electron donor showed similar results, i.e., the mutant showed limited or no growth with nitrate, fumarate and DMSO provided as electron acceptors compared to the wild type (Figure 4).
Similar to the lactate-amended cultures, the rates of nitrate, fumarate and DMSO reduction in wild type cultures exceeded those measured in cultures of the mutant strain (Table 1).
Resting cell assays corroborated these findings and nitrate reduction and ammonium production occurred at higher rates in assays with wild type cells.
Complete stoichiometric conversion to ammonium also occurred in the assays with mutant cells, although lower rates and a 3-fold longer incubation were required for complete reduction (i.e., 24 h for the EtrA7-1 versus 8 h for the wild type) (Figure 5).



Effects of etrA deletion on transcription

The global transcriptome profile of mutant strain EtrA7-1 grown anaerobically with nitrate as the sole electron acceptor was compared to that of the wild type under the same growth conditions.
A complete list of all the genes differentially expressed two-fold or higher is provided as supplemental information (Additional file 1).
Out of 612 differentially transcribed genes in the EtrA7-1 mutant relative to the wild type, 289 were up-regulated and 323 were down-regulated.
The differentially transcribed genes were classified in 19 functional "TIGR Role" categories (Additional file 2) based on the MR-1 genome annotation (GenBank accession number AE014299) [22].
Genes with unknown functions represented the largest category of up-regulated (14.8%) and the second most common category of down-regulated genes (17.3%).
Genes associated with energy metabolism were the largest category (17.6%) of down-regulated genes (Additional file 2).
Among the up-regulated genes, the "Protein synthesis" category ranked second (12.5%) and the "Other categories" ranked third (11.4%).
This latter category included phage-, transposase- and plasmid-related genes.
The "Energy metabolism" category represented 9.7%, ranking fourth.



Identification of putative EtrA binding sites

The promoters of the differentially expressed genes were examined for putative EtrA binding sites in order to identify those genes that were likely directly regulated by EtrA from the many genes whose expression changes were most likely due to secondary effects.
For example, the up-regulation of phage-related genes is likely a response to stress, and not a direct result of the etrA deletion.
Putative EtrA binding sites were identified for those genes that showed at least 2.5 fold change in the EtrA7-1 mutant relative to the wild type by extracting the upstream intergenic sequences and applying the Gibbs centroid sampler to identify a putative binding site motif.
A motif was identified (Additional file 3) that displays similarities to the E. coli Fnr and Crp binding sites motifs; this motif was present upstream of 44 operons that encode a total of 78 genes.
The largest proportion of these genes is in the "Energy metabolism" category (Table 2 and 3, Additional file 2).
Binding sites were detected upstream of an additional 28 operons when the detected motif (Additional file 3) was used to scan the upstream intergenic regions of all genes listed in Additional file 1.



Regulatory role of EtrA in energy metabolism

Since the "Energy metabolism" category contained the largest group of genes responsive to EtrA, these genes were analyzed in more detail.
Up-regulated genes (Table 2) in this group included genes encoding a cytochrome c oxidase (ccoPQN [SO2361-2362, SO2364]), proteins involved in gluconeogenesis such as PckA (SO0162), and nqrABCDEF-2 genes (SO1103-1108) encoding NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases.
From this group, only the nqr gene clusters had a putative EtrA binding site.

While the nqr-2 gene cluster was up-regulated in the etrA knockout mutant, the nqr-1 gene cluster (SO0903-0907) was down-regulated.
Nqr is a Na+ pump that during respiration generates a sodium motive force to mediate solute transport, flagellar motility and ATP synthesis [23].
Both nqr gene clusters had putative EtrA binding sites.
The microarray data indicated that EtrA affects the transcription pattern of these genes differently.
Similarly, the etrA deletion had a distinct effect on the expression of the fdh gene clusters encoding a formate dehydrogenase.
The fdh-1 genes (SO4508-4511) were up-regulated whereas the fdh-2 gene cluster (SO4512-4515) was down-regulated.
An EtrA binding site was only identified for the fdh-2 cluster and not for the fdh-1 cluster, indicating EtrA affects both clusters differently.

Other up-regulated genes in the "Energy metabolism" category included the succinate dehydrogenase gene sdhC (SO1927), the succinyl-CoA synthase operon sucABCD (SO1930-1933), the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase and the acetyl CoA-synthase genes (SO1891-1892).

Down-regulated genes in the "Energy metabolism" category (Table 3), which were predicted for direct regulation by EtrA, included genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, especially in nitrate respiration like the napBHGAD operon (SO0845-0849, strongly repressed with all subunit genes except napD with ratios LTEQ 0.18), and the nrfA (SO3980) genes.
cymA (SO4591; ratio 0.39), the prismane protein hcp gene (SO1363), and neighboring protein hcr gene (SO1364), both of which were strongly repressed (ratios LTEQ 0.13) and have been associated with the nitrate reduction pathway [24-27], did not show evidence of EtrA binding sites.
Also indirectly down-regulated were the fumarate reductase genes frdAB (SO0398-0399) and fccA (SO0970), the ackA and the pta (SO2915-16) genes involved in acetate production and the ppc (SO0274) gene encoding an acetate phosphoenol pyruvate carboxylase.
The hyaCBA (SO2097-2099) genes encoding a quinone-reactive Ni/Fe hydrogenase were highly indirectly repressed (ratio LTEQ 0.11).
Among the genes identified as directly down-regulated are all the genes in the operon that encodes the anaerobic DMSO reductase (dmsAB) (SO1428-32), the cydAB genes (SO3285-3286) encoding a cytochrome d oxidase complex, as well as genes involved in metabolism of organic compounds such as the pflAB (SO2912-2913).

Other down-regulated genes grouped in different categories included genes encoding ABC transporters (cydCD [SO3779-3780], SO4446-4448), TonB-dependent receptors (nosA [SO0630]), and L-lactate permease (lldP [SO0827]) and a putative lactate permease (SO1522).
The only gene directly down-regulated from this later group is lldP (SO0827), for which an EtrA binding site was predicted (Table 3).
As expected, the cDNA for etrA, shows no significant hybridization signal in EtrA7-1 mutant (ratio 0.05).



Stress response caused by the etrA deletion

We detected induction of genes from various categories, which have been associated with stress response i.e., starvation, phage infection and oxidative stress, possibly due to accumulation of nitrogen oxide reactive species.
Up-regulated genes (Additional file 1) were dominated by genes grouped in "Other categories".
The majority of up-regulated genes were phage-related.
For example, 25 genes of the LambdaSo phage (SO2940-2974), a gene encoding a viral capsid protein of the MuSo1 phage (SO0675), and genes of MuSo2 phage (SO2684-2685, SO2687, SO2702) were up-regulated.
In contrast, the gene encoding the LambdaSo phage transcriptional regulator of the Cro/CI family (SO2990) was down-regulated (ratio 0.43).
Transcriptional changes of most of these genes are likely indirect effects due to the deletion of the etrA gene and only for the LambdaSo phage genes S02957-2962 was an EtrA binding site predicted.

The category "Transport and binding proteins" contains a large number of genes associated with stress response.
Up-regulated genes in this group contain genes encoding heavy metal efflux pumps (SO0520, SO4596-4598, SOA0153) and genes for phosphate transport (SO1560, SO1723-1724 including pstB-1 [SO1725], pstB-2 [SO4289] and pstA [SO4290]).
There was up-regulation of phoBR (SO1558-59) and phoU (SO1726) genes, which regulate the phosphate transporters genes during phosphate starvation [28-32].

Up-regulated genes in response to stress conditions i.e., starvation, phage infection, oxidative stress, include a stringent starvation protein encoded by the sspAB genes (SO0611-0612)[33], and a phage shock protein operon pspABC (SO1807-1809)[34].
Other up-regulated stress-related genes were the RNA polymerase sigma-70 factor rpoD (SO1284)[32,35], a GTP-binding protein that regulates the TCA cycle and responds to starvation (era [SO1349])[36], and a DNA repair protein (recO [SO1350])[37].
