The CcpA-dependent protein expression

In a previous work we have isolated the L. plantarum LM3-2(ccpA1) strain, carrying a null mutation in the ccpA gene [28].
We analyzed the electrophoretic pattern of cytosolic proteins extracted from LM3 and LM3-2 cells, grown under standard conditions up to mid-exponential phase (Fig. 1).
The presence of differentially expressed proteins in the two strains, together with results of previous studies [28,29] demonstrated the role of CcpA as global regulator in L. plantarum.
Among the differentially expressed proteins analyzed, one of them, with apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa, was identified by in-gel tryptic digestion and MALDI-TOF (Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight) analysis as the GroEL protein (Fig. 1).
Indeed, the GroEL protein appears to be more abundant in the LM3 wild type strain compared to the LM3-2 mutant strain, suggesting the involvement of the CcpA protein in the positive regulation of its expression.
In Bacillus subtilis the expression of the GroEL and GroES molecular chaperons have been linked to the CcpA protein, but it is interesting to point out that in this model system expression of the two proteins appeared to be under the CcpA negative regulation [30].
The different CcpA-dependent control of the groESL operon in the two model systems may have been influenced by the diverse growth condition used.



CcpA affects heat shock survival

CcpA has been found to be involved in various stress responses using different microorganisms as model system.
In Listeria monocytogenes CcpA is overexpressed under salt stress conditions together with other general metabolism proteins (alanine dehydrogenase, CysK, EF-Tu, Gap, GuaB, PdhA, PdhD), and general stress proteins (Ctc and DnaK) [31].
In Enterococcus faecalis CcpA negatively regulates the expression of 13 starvation-inducible proteins [32].
In Lactococcus lactis the production of CcpA is induced about three times upon exposure to low temperature [33].
In order to investigate the effect of the ccpA1 mutation on the heat shock response in L. plantarum, cell cultures of the LM3 (wt) and LM3-2 (ccpA1) strains were grown up to exponential phase in MRS with 2% glucose and challenged with high temperature (55 degrees C) for 1 h.
The percent of survival for each strain was determined by plating on MRS agar and by comparing the number of live cells after heat shock to the number of live cells before the shock.
Under these experimental conditions the percent of survival was extremely low, being 0.07% and 0.004% for LM3 and LM3-2 respectively (Fig. 2A).
When the two strains were challenged with the temperature of 50 degrees C for 1 h, the LM3 strain showed 43% survival versus 14% survival of the LM3-2 strain (Fig. 2B).
In the first case, the experimental conditions appeared to be very extreme for both strains, still the mutant strain showing a percent of survival 17 fold lower than the wild type strain.
When challenged with a less severe heat shock conditions, the LM3-2 strain showed a percent of survival 3 fold lower than the LM3 strain.
These results suggest a positive role of CcpA in the heat shock response in L. plantarum.
The heat shock temperature of 50 degrees C was chosen for further studies.



Transcriptional analysis of the groESL operon

Primer extension experiments were performed using total RNA extracted from the LM3 and LM3-2 cell cultures grown up to exponential phase at 30 degrees C and then left at 30 degrees C (control) or challenged at 50 degrees C for 15 minutes.
No differences in the groESL basal transcription were observed in the two strains when incubated at 30 degrees C; after heat shock at 50 degrees C, instead, a transcriptional activation of the groESL operon occurred in both strains, but at a greater extent in the wild type compared to the mutant strain (Fig. 3A).
A quantitative analysis by PhosphorImager showed that transcription of the groESL operon was induced 12-fold in the LM3 wild type strain (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 2), while only 5-fold in LM3-2 mutant strain (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 4).
As a control, primer extension analysis of transcripts from the lp_rRNA01 locus, transcribing a 16S rRNA, was performed, and a PhosphorImager analysis showed a 1:1 ratio among the 4 samples (Fig. 3C).
The sequence analysis of the groESL promoter region revealed the presence of the CIRCE element of 9 bp separated by 9 bp spacer, with the DNA sequence TTAGCACTT-N9-GAGTGCTAA, starting four nucleotide residues downstream of the start site of transcription.
This putative CIRCE element is characterized by one mismatch with respect to the consensus sequence (9th nucleotide residue position) [6].
Furthermore, the sequence analysis revealed the presence of a putative CcpA-binding site (cre), centered at -147.5 with respect to the start point of transcription (Fig. 4A).



Transcriptional analysis of the dnaK operon

On the basis of the observed effect of CcpA on the induction of the groESL transcription in L. plantarum after exposure to heat shock, we proceeded in the analysis of the expression of the other class I heat shock operon, namely the dnaK operon.
The L. plantarum tetra-cistronic dnaK operon consists of the hrcA gene, coding for the transcriptional repressor HrcA, followed by the grpE, dnaK and dnaJ genes, coding for the three proteins constituting the DnaK chaperon complex [15].
Primer extension experiments were performed by using total RNA extracted from the LM3 and LM3-2 cell cultures grown up to exponential phase at 30 degrees C and then left at 30 degrees C (control) or challenged at 50 degrees C for 15 minutes (Fig. 3B).
The results were similar to those obtained for the transcriptional analysis of the groESL operon.
No detectable differences were found in the basal expression of the operon at 30 degrees C in the two strains.
On the contrary, transcription of the dnaK operon was induced 16-fold in the LM3 wild type strain (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2) and only 8-fold in the LM3-2 mutant strain upon exposure to a heat shock (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 4), as measured by a quantitative analysis by PhosphorImager.
The sequence analysis of the groESL promoter region revealed the presence of the CIRCE element of 9 bp separated by 9 bp spacer, with the DNA sequence TTAGCACTC-N9-AAGTGCTAA, starting three nucleotide residues downstream of the start site of transcription.
As well as for the groESL promoter, this putative CIRCE element is characterized by one mismatch with respect to the consensus sequence (19th nucleotide residue position).
A putative CcpA binding site (cre) is centered at -117.5 with respect to the start point of transcription (Fig. 4A).

Class I heat shock operons have been shown so far to be negatively regulated by the HrcA/CIRCE system.
We show that a positive regulation mediated by the CcpA protein also occurs for full expression of these operons in L. plantarum.



Analysis of cre sequences

The cre sequence is described as an 18 bp consensus sequence for binding of the CcpA protein in the promoter region of genes and operons subjected to catabolite repression [34].
The two putative cre sequences centered at -147.5 and at -117.5 in the promoter region of the groESL and dnaK operons respectively, contain an additional base with respect to the consensus described by Miwa and coworkers (Fig. 4B) [34].
An additional base also characterizes the cre1 element found in the regulatory region of the ackA gene of Bacillus subtilis, whose expression is controlled by a CcpA-mediated activation mechanism [35].
Nevertheless, the cre1 sequence, centered in position -116.5, does not seem to be functional to the CcpA-mediated activation of the operon under the tested conditions, probably due to the presence of the cre2 promoter proximal sequence [35].
