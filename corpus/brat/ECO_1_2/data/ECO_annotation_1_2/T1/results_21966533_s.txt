Mutation and complementation

Real-time RT-PCR experiments were performed to assess the relative mRNA levels of phoP and rovA in the corresponding WT, mutant, and complemented mutant strains.
The phoP transcript was lacking in DeltaphoP, but was restored in C-phoP relative to WT, and moreover similar results were observed for the rovA transcript in WT, DeltarovA, and C-rovA (data not shown).
These data indicates the successful mutation and complementation of phoP and rovA.

To test whether the phoP or rovA mutation had the polar effect, the primer extension assays were conducted to detect the yield of the rovA primer extension product that represents the rovA transcriptional levels in the corresponding WT, mutant, and complemented mutant strains (Figure S1).
As determined by several distinct methods (see below), the rovA gene was positively regulated by RovA under condition I, whereas it was under the negative control of PhoP under condition II.
As determined by the primer extension assays herein, the rovA transcription under condition I was significantly repressed in DeltarovA relative to WT, and restored in C-rovA; its transcription under condition II was significantly elevated in DeltaphoP relative to both C-phoP and WT (Figure S1).
The rovA gene yielded almost the same transcriptional levels between the paired WT/DeltaphoP or WT/DeltarovA strains.
This complementation analysis confirmed that the observed PhoP or RovA-dependent transcription of rovA was due to the phoP or rovA mutation, respectively, rather than a polar mutation.



Growth of WT, DeltarovA, and DeltaphoP

The growth curves of the WT, DeltarovA, and DeltaphoP strains grown at 26 degrees C under three different conditions I, II, and III were determined (Fig. 1).
Under condition I, both DeltarovA and DeltaphoP exhibited growth rates lower than WT (Fig. 1a).
Under condition II, growth restriction was observed for DeltaphoP rather than DeltarovA relative to WT (Fig. 1b).
The three strains showed indistinguishable growth rates under condition III (Fig. 1c).
For each strain, bacterial growth was impeded under suboptimal conditions II and III relative to the original condition I.
In particular, bacterial cells exhibited very poor growth when each of strain was grown under condition II.

Bacterial cells were harvested at the middle-exponential or stationary phase for the following cell culture-related biochemical assays, and the time points for cell harvest were defined strictly according to the growth curves (Fig. 1d).
It should be noted that bacterial cells grown under different conditions or those of different isogenic stains were harvested at the identical growth phase, rather than the identical optical density, which would devoid the secondary effects of growth rate or phase.
In addition, temperature upshift from 26 to 37 degrees C was designed prior to cell harvest, generating 26 ("26 degrees C continuously") and 37 degrees C ("shift from 26 to 37 degrees C") grown cells.



Transcription of rovA under different temperatures

The primer extension experiments (Fig. 2) were then conducted to determine the yields of primer extension product of rovA (i.e., the relative rovA transcription levels, or the relative rovA promoter activities) in WT upon the above temperature upshift.
The primer extension assay detected two transcriptional start sites located at 343 and 78 bp upstream of rovA (Fig. 2); therefore, two promoters (named P2 and P1, respectively) were transcribed for rovA.
At the middle-exponential growth phase (Fig. 2a), the P2 promoter activity showed no obvious change upon the temperature upshift under conditions I, II, and III; yet, the P1 promoter activity decreased upon temperature upshift under all the three growth conditions.
At the stationary growth phase (Fig. 2b), the promoter activities of both P2 and P1 decreased upon temperature upshift under all the three growth conditions.
In conclusion, the temperature shift from 26 to 37 degrees C triggered the down-regulation of both P2 and P1 promoters of rovA at the stationary growth phase.
However, the down-regulatory effect occurred only for P2 at the middle-exponential growth phase.

For subsequent experiments, only bacterial cultures of "shift from 26 to 37 degrees C" were analyzed, as 37 degrees C is the temperature during human infections.



Autoregulation of RovA

A rovA-lacZ fusion vector, containing the 889 bp promoter-proximal region of rovA and the promoterless lacZ, was transformed into both WT and DeltarovA to compare the rovA promoter activities in these two strains grown under conditions I, II, and III, respectively (Fig. 3a).
Under all the three conditions, the expression of rovA significantly decreased in DeltarovA relative to WT.
In addition, the primer extension experiments (Fig. 3b) were conducted to compare the yields of primer extension product of rovA in WT and DeltarovA; the activities of both P1 and P2 promoters were under the positive control of RovA under all the three growth conditions, which was consistent with the above lacZ fusion data.
Interestingly, the rovA transcription in WT were up-regulated under condition III relative to the other two conditions (Fig. 2a and 2b), and thus mild acid appeared to stimulate the rovA expression.

The 889 bp promoter-proximal region of rovA tested in the LacZ fusion assay was amplified, radioactively labeled, and subjected to EMSA with a purified His-RovA protein (Fig. 3c).
The results show that His-RovA is able to bind to this DNA fragment in a dose-dependent manner in vitro (Fig. 3c).
As further determined by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 3d), the purified His-RovA protected two distinct regions upstream of rovA against DNase I digestion in a dose-dependent manner.
These two footprints, located from 592 to 502 bp (RovA site 2) and from 39 to 6 bp (Site 1) upstream of rovA, respectively, were considered RovA sites.
Taken together, RovA is able to recognize all the promoters of its own gene to stimulate their activity in Y. pestis.

To test the affinity of RovA to Sites 1 and 2, EMSA was performed with two distinct rovA upstream DNA fragments containing Sites 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 4).
DNA retardation occurred at 0.74 pmol of His-RovA for the fragment containing Site 2 (Fig. 4a), whereas it was observed at 2.46 pmol for that containing Site 1 (Fig. 4b).
This indicated that RovA had a much higher affinity to Site 2 than Site 1.
The RovA proteins at all amounts used could not bind to the 16S rDNA fragment as the negative control, confirming the specificity of EMSA in this study (Fig. 4c).



Negative regulation of rovA by PhoP

The rovA-lacZ fusion vector (Fig. 3a) was transformed into both WT and DeltaphoP to compare the rovA promoter activities in the two strains grown under conditions I, II, and III (Fig. 5a).
Under conditions I and III, there was no significant difference in the rovA promoter activities in the WT and DeltaphoP strains.
Under condition II, the expression of rovA was significantly enhanced in the DeltaphoP relative to the WT.
Further primer extension experiments for rovA (Fig. 5b) again detected the two promoters, P1 and P2, when the bacterial cells were grown under the three conditions.
P1 activity was under the negative control of PhoP under condition II, and independent of this regulator under the other two growth conditions.
PhoP had no effect on P2 activity under all the three conditions.
The EMSA assay disclosed that the purified His-PhoP protein was able to bind to the 889 promoter-proximal region of rovA in a dose-dependent manner in vitro (Fig. 5c).
Subsequent DNase I footprinting experiments (Fig. 5d) indicated that His-PhoP protected a single region located from 102 to 47 bp upstream of rovA.
This footprint was considered the PhoP site.
Therefore, the rovA transcription is negatively controlled by the PhoP regulator under the low magnesium conditions through the PhoP-promoter DNA association.



Promoter structure of rovA

In this study, DNase I footprinting experiments precisely determined the PhoP and RovA sites for rovA.
The primer extension assays mapped two promoters (P1 and P2) for rovA.
Accordingly, the core promoter -10 and -35 elements for RNA polymerase recognition were predicted.
Collection of data on the translation/transcription start sites, Shine-Dalgarno sequence (a ribosomal binding site in the mRNA), promoter -10 and -35 elements, as well as PhoP and RovA sites enabled us to depict the organization of PhoP and RovA-dependent promoters of rovA characterized herein (Fig. 6).
The Y. pestis rovA promoter-proximal region is essentially identical to the Y. pseudotuberculosis one [28].
The two RovA sites within the rovA promoter-proximal region in Y. pestis are very similar to, although slightly different from, those determined in Y. pseudotuberculosis[17].
Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. pestis have the same P2 promoter, but P1 in Y. pestis is 2 bp upstream of that in Y. pseudotuberculosis.
The slight differences observed in the P1 sites and the RovA site sequences might be due to the personal inclination during DNA sequence reading.
