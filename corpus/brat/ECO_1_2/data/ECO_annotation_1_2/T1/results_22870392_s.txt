3.1.AdpA interacts in vivo with the origin of replication in Streptomyces coelicolor

In order to identify replication origin binding protein(s) that might control initiation in S. coelicolor, we applied streptavidin affinity chromatography using biotinylated oriC as bait (see electronic supplementary material, materials and methods for detailed information).
A 42.8 kDa protein was fished out from a cell extract prepared from a sample of a 44-hour-old S. coelicolor M145 culture (which had already formed aerial hyphae) growing on solid minimal medium supplemented with 1 per cent mannitol, but not from the extract of younger cultures.
The protein was identified by mass spectroscopy (28% protein sequence coverage) as AdpA - a master transcriptional regulator of aerial mycelium formation [22,26,27].
In order to verify that AdpA was able to bind oriC in vivo, we performed formaldehyde cross-linking of proteins to DNA in intact cells followed by selective immunoprecipitation of protein - DNA complexes with anti-AdpA antibodies, as described previously [24].
As noted in the previous publication, we encountered difficulties with the cross-linking reaction in cultures grown on a solid medium, and therefore used the S. coelicolor M851 ptipAadpA strain, which is capable of producing AdpA in liquid culture upon induction with thiostrepton [24].
AdpA - oriC complexes were indeed detected after induction of this strain (set #1, lane S, figure 1d) - intensity of this band was comparable with the positive control (set #1, lane +) - whereas no signal was observed in the adpA deletion strain M851+pIJ6902-hyg (set #2, lane S), which served as negative control.
These results indicate capability of forming AdpA - oriC complexes in vivo.

In summary, AdpA, a well-known transcription factor involved in the formation of aerial hyphae, binds the oriC region in vitro and in vivo.
This suggests that AdpA might play a role in addition to that of transcriptional regulator, namely regulating the initiation of chromosome replication.



3.2.AdpA specifically binds the 5'-end of the oriC region

An in silico search allowed identification of three putative AdpA-binding sequences (named A1 - A3 boxes) at the conventional 5'-end of oriC.
Their sequences differed from the consensus 5'-TGGCSNGWWY-3' [22] by one nucleotide, and two A boxes (A1 and A2) partially overlapped (figure 1a,c).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) demonstrated that AdpAHis6 specifically bound the oriC fragment (283-bp) containing the in silico-predicted A-boxes in a concentration-dependent manner (figures 1b and 2a), but not the remaining part of oriC (data not shown).
Additionally, EMSA showed the presence of one nucleoprotein complex at a low AdpAHis6 concentration, whereas increasing protein concentrations resulted in the formation of a ladder of higher-molecular-mass complexes (figure 1b).
Moreover, the SPR analysis (figure 2a) revealed that dissociation of AdpAHis6 was slow, suggesting that the AdpA - oriC complexes are fairly stable.
DNase I footprinting confirmed binding of the AdpA to the two in silico-predicted overlapping A boxes (figure 1c).


Taken together, our results demonstrate that AdpA specifically binds A boxes within the 5' end of the S. coelicolor oriC region and forms a large, stable nucleoprotein complex.



3.3.AdpA and DnaA proteins compete for oriC-binding in an ATP-dependent manner

The two overlapping A boxes (A1 and A2) are directly flanked by weak DnaA boxes (1 and 2) containing two mismatches from the consensus (figure 1a).
Our previous mutational analysis of individual DnaA boxes showed that replication of minichromosomes depends on all DnaA boxes, including those that are located next to the A boxes [28].
Because AdpA binding led to extended DNA protection that partially overlapped the functional DnaA boxes (DnaA boxes 1 and 2), we expected that accessibility of the weak DnaA boxes to DnaA protein would be limited in the presence of AdpA protein.
To demonstrate that AdpA modulates DnaA accessibility to oriC, we mutated the two overlapping A boxes, A1 and A2, in such a way that the sequences of the adjacent DnaA boxes (1 and 2) and the distance between them were not altered.
A subsequent DNase I footprinting experiment clearly showed that the mutated region (oriCDeltaA1A2) was not protected by AdpA (figure 1c).
SPR analyses revealed that AdpA protein exhibited lower affinity towards oriCDeltaA1A2 than towards wild-type oriC (oriC WT), but the mutation did not alter the affinity of DnaA protein (figure 2a(i,ii)).
Mutation of the A1A2 boxes reduced binding of AdpA to the oriC fragment and destabilized the nucleoprotein complex formed by increasing the dissociation of AdpA from oriCDeltaA1A2 (figure 2a(i)).
Co-injection experiments showed that binding of AdpA to the analysed DNA fragments considerably reduced binding of DnaA protein to oriC WT compared with oriCDeltaA1A2 (see association curves, figure 2a(iii,iv)).
This finding demonstrates that AdpA competes with DnaA for the oriC fragment containing A boxes, considerably reducing the accessibility of oriC to DnaA.

It should be noted that S. coelicolor DnaA, like that of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [29], binds DnaA box(es), particularly weak ones, more efficiently in the presence of ATP (figure 2b(ii)).
Interestingly, we found that the affinity of AdpA protein for A boxes was substantially reduced in the presence of ATP.
As shown in SPR analyses (figure 2b(i)), ATP at the same concentration used for DnaA-binding experiments nearly completely abolished binding of AdpA to the AdpA boxes.
To confirm this intriguing observation, we cross-linked AdpA and DNA in the presence of increasing amounts of ATP (figure 2b(iii)).
In this assay, ATP prevented the formation of AdpA - DNA complexes in a concentration-dependent manner, an outcome consistent with the results obtained by SPR analysis.
Interestingly, a similar effect was also observed in the presence of ADP (see electronic supplementary material, figure S1b), which suggests that the energy status (ATP/ADP) of the cell does not exert influence on binding of this protein to DNA.

In summary, our results show that AdpA and DnaA proteins compete for oriC-binding in an ATP-dependent complementary manner, such that the presence of ATP favours DnaA binding, and the absence of ATP favours AdpA binding.



3.4.Mutation of an AdpA-binding motif within oriC influences colony maturation and replication rate

Because AdpA, acting as a transcription factor, binds promoters of many genes that are important for the formation of aerial hyphae [21,22], we expected that binding of AdpA to the oriC region might also have a specific function during differentiation of Streptomyces.
To investigate the biological role of AdpA - oriC complex formation, we constructed the S. coelicolorDeltaA1A2 strain, in which a mutation of the overlapping A1 and A2 boxes (the same mutation as described earlier) was introduced within the native oriC locus (for details see electronic supplementary material).
The mutant formed aerial hyphae (visible as a white confluent fluffy layer) substantially earlier than the wild-type strain, particularly on R2YE medium (figure 3a): aerial hyphae were already noticeable within 52 h, whereas an aerial hyphal layer was poorly visible even at 91 h in the wild-type strain (figure 3a).
The expression profile of the adpA gene was not altered in the mutant strain compared with the wild-type strain (data not shown), ruling out unexpected changes in adpA expression as an explanation for the accelerated development.


These results suggested that AdpA might be involved in the regulation of chromosome replication - specifically, by acting as an inhibitor of chromosome replication, particularly affecting aerial growth.
To examine this hypothesis, we quantified the abundance of oriC region copies and chromosome terminus (ter) copies on chromosomal DNA isolated from wild-type and mutant strains using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis (figure 3b).
In this analysis, which used primers targeting sites near oriC (gyrB gene, centrally located on the linear chromosome) and argG, close to one end of the chromosome, the oriC-to-argG ratio reflects the frequency of replication initiation.
The ratio was normalized internally using DNA isolated from spores, which are replication-inactive.
At early stages of growth when AdpA was expressed at low level (20 h) [24], the oriC/argG ratio for the mutant strain was similar to that of the wild-type strain.
However, as aerial hyphae became visible and AdpA was synthesized at higher levels (34 h; the highest AdpA levels were observed at around 36 h and remained high within subsequent hours [24]), the ratio was about 50 per cent higher for the mutant strain than for the wild-type strain, indicating more frequent initiation in the mutant compared with the wild-type, particularly at 54 h, when the wild-type ratio subsided to unity, but the mutant ratio remained high.
The fluctuations of the ratio in the wild-type and the mutant (the same values at 44 h; figure 3a) may be results of the decrease in AdpA concentration between 36 h and 48 h reported previously [24].
Thus, these results support the idea that AdpA acts as a repressor of replication initiation prior to the emergence of aerial hyphae by binding to oriC-linked AdpA-binding sequences, and that mutation of these sequences increased the accessibility of oriC to DnaA, resulting in earlier replication in substrate mycelium compartments capable of giving rise to aerial branches.
Interestingly, in the wild-type strain containing an additional copy of adpA gene under the inducible promoter, ptipA, we observed slowed aerial mycelium formation (data not shown), which supports the idea mentioned earlier.
The high ratio observed in the 54 h time point with the mutant might suggest that AdpA also affects replication at the time of sporulation, but further analysis of the mutant will be needed to determine whether its development at this stage is normal (for example, the premature growth of aerial hyphae might be followed by another round of aerial growth as the vegetative mycelium continues to accumulate biomass).
