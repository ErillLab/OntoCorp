The Extra-Cellular Death Factor (EDF) is involved in the inhibition of the SOS response

In previous studies we showed that EDF, the penta-peptide NNWNN, is involved in EDF-mazEF mediated cell death [7], and that clpX is required for the production of EDF [8].
Since, more recently we found that the action of the mazEF module prevented the SOS response [19]; here we asked if, in addition to the mazEF module, the presence of EDF is also involved in the inhibition of the SOS response.
As previously [19], we also here studied the SOS response by the use of plasmid pL(lexO)-gfp[22], which bears the gene gfp under the control of the lexA operator, lexO.
In this plasmid, under uninduced conditions, LexA represses gfp transcription by binding to the SOS box in the gene operator, lexO.
Under DNA damage, RecA becomes activated, and acts as a co-protease stimulating the inactivation of LexA by auto-cleavage.
Thus, in this system, fluorescence is a reporter for the RecA dependent SOS response.
We caused DNA damage by adding nalidixic acid (NA) (10 microg/ml) to the cultures [19].
Our experiments have revealed that the SOS response was permitted not only in an E. coli MC4100relA+ strain from which we deleted mazEF (MC4100relA+DeltamazEF) [19], but also when, instead of deleting mazEF, we deleted clpX (MC4100relA+DeltaclpX) (Figure 1A).
This effect seems to be due to the lack of EDF because: (a) the addition of EDF partially inhibits the studied SOS response (by 50%), and (b) the SOS response is not affected at all by the addition of iEDF (Figure 1A), the penta-peptide NNGNN, in which the central and crucial tryptophan has been replaced by glycine [8].
Adding iEDF to the MC4100relA+DeltaclpX culture did not affect the SOS response at all (Figure 1A).
Similar results were obtained when instead of studying the SOS response by the use of plasmid pL(lexO)-gfp, we studied it by following the NA-induced LexA degradation (Figure 1D).
Here, LexA degradation, thus SOS response is not permitted in E. coli MC4100relA+ strain carrying the mazEF module (Figure1D, first line).
However, deleting clpX (MC4100relA+DeltaclpX) permitted LexA degradation (Figure 1D, second line).
On the other hand, the addition of EDF prevented LexA degradation (Figure 1D, third line), while LexA degradation is permitted by the addition of iEDF (Figure 1D, fourth line).

An additional support that EDF is involved in the mazEF mediated inhibition of the SOS response is derived from our studies with E. coli strain MG1655.
In our previous work, we showed that E. coli strain MG1655, which carries the mazEF gene pair is defective in the production of and the response to EDF [8].
Here we found that, despite the presence of mazEF, the SOS response took place in strain MG1655 (Figure 1B).
Furthermore, 240 minutes after adding EDF, we observed a 50% reduction in the SOS response; in contrast, adding iEDF did not cause any reduction in the SOS response (Figure 1B).
Similar results were also obtained in E. coli strain MG1655 by studying the NA-induced LexA degradation (Figure 1E) under the SOS response condition.
Also here, LexA degradation, thus the SOS response is permitted in E. coli MG1655 (Figure 1E, first line).
On the other hand, the addition of EDF significantly prevented LexA degradation (Figure 1E, second line), while LexA degradation is again permitted by the addition of iEDF (Figure 1E, third line).
All of these results support our hypothesis that the SOS response was permitted in the absence of EDF.

Using our fluorescence reporter system, we tested the SOS response in two additional E. coli strains.
In strain AB1932 [23] the addition of EDF did not inhibit the SOS response (Figure S1).
However, in E. coli strain BW25113, which has commonly been used to study the phenomena of the SOS response [23] - [24], the addition of EDF did reduce the SOS response (Figure 1C).
Adding EDF to E. coli strain BW25113 led to a 30% reduction in the SOS response; again, as in the case for strains MC4100relA+DeltaclpX (Figure 1A), and MG1655 (Figure 1B), adding iEDF did not lead to a reduction in the SOS response (Figure 1C).
Similar results were obtained in E.coli strain BW25113 by determining the NA-induced LexA degradation.
Also here, LexA degradation is permitted (Figure 1F, first line).
However, its degradation is prevented by the addition of EDF (Figure 1F, second line), but not by the addition of iEDF (Figure 1F, third line).
Thus, the SOS response is permitted in E.coli strains BW25113 and MG1655.
This because of unknown reasons there is a deficiency of EDF in these strains (Table 1).

Our findings suggesting that the SOS response is permitted in E.coli strains due to the lack of EDF is also manifested by testing the viability of these strains under conditions of DNA damage (Figure 2).
In E.coli strain MC4100relA+, in which the SOS responds is prevented (Figure 1A and 1D), cell viability is reduced by about 3 folds under such condition (Figure 2).
In contrast, in the DeltaclpX derivative of MC4100relA+ which is defective in the generation of EDF (Figure 1A and 1D), cell viability is not affected under the SOS conditions (Figure 2).
However, by applying EDF cell survival is reduced by about 2 folds, and this reduction in viability does not occur by applying iEDF (Figure 2).
A similar manifestation on the effect of DNA damage on cell viability was also observed in E.coli strains MG1655 and BW25113.
These strains which are permitting the SOS response due to their lack of EDF (Figures 1B, 1E and Figure 1C, 1F, respectively), also permit cell survival under the SOS conditions (Figure 2).
However, cell viability was reduced by about two folds when EDF was applied to these stains, and this reduction in viability does not occur by applying iEDF (Figure 2).



The SOS response is permitted in E. coli strains carrying prophage lambda

One of the few genes expressed by phage lambda in its lysogenic state is lambdarexB[25] - [27].
In previous work, we showed that its product, lambdaRexB, inhibits the degradation of the antitoxic labile compound, MazE, thereby preventing mazF mediated death pathway [28].
Therefore, we anticipated that, in contrast to E. coli strain MC4100relA+ in which the SOS response is prevented (Figure 1A and 1D), in the presence of a lambda prophage the SOS response would be permitted in this strain.
As we expected, the presence of the lambda prophage overcame the inhibitory effect of mazEF on the SOS response (Figure 3A).
Similar results were obtained in E. coli strain MC4100relA+ when instead of studying the SOS response by the use of plasmid pL(lexO)-gfp, we studied it by following LexA degradation (Figure 3C).
Here, the NA-induced LexA degradation, thus the SOS response, is permitted in an E. coli strain carrying prophage lambda, MC4100relA+lambda (Figure 3C, second line), and not in the absence of the prophage from the chromosome of this bacterial strain (Figure 3C, first line).
Also, in E.coli strain AB1932, in which the SOS response has been observed [23], and which has been reported to bear a lambda prophage on its chromosome [23], we observed the SOS response both by the use of plasmid pL(lexO)-gfp (Figure 3B) and by following LexA degradation (Figure 3D, first line).
Furthermore, deleting rexB from its lambda prophage reduced the SOS response by 50%, while introducing a plasmid bearing lambdarexB and inducing it permitted the SOS response (Figure 3B).
In addition, deleting rexB from its lambda prophage stabilized LexA degradation (Figure 3D, second line), while introducing a plasmid bearing lambdarexB and inducing it permitted LexA degradation (Figure 3D, third line), Thus, our results provide an explanation for the SOS response in strain AB1932lambda (Table 1).

Our findings suggesting that the SOS response is permitted in an E.coli strain carrying prophage lambda was further supported by testing the viability of strain AB1932lambda under conditions of DNA damage (Figure 4A).
In this strain, in which we have shown that the SOS responds is permitted due to the presence of lambdarexB gene (Figures 3B and 3D), We found that also cell viability is reduced by about two folds under conditions of DNA damage (Figure 4A).
In contrast, in the DeltarexB derivative of strain AB1932lambda in which the SOS response is severely affected (Figures 3B and 3D); cell viability is not affected under the SOS conditions (Figure 4A).
However, introducing a plasmid bearing lambdarexB and inducing it, lead to the reduction of cell viability by about two orders (Figure 4A).

Furthermore, as expected, the observed reduction in cell viability by applying DNA damaging conditions to E.coli strain AB1932 lambda carrying the rexB gene (Figure 4A) is due to the transfer of the phage from its lysogenic to its lytic stage (Figure 4B).
This is here shown by the determination of the plaque forming ability of the phage which we found to be 109 PFU/ml when the lambda lysogens carried rexB or when lambda rexB was carried on a plasmid, and 106 PFU/ml in the absence of lambdarexB (Figure 4B).
Such a result is an outcome of the process of the induction of prophage lambda which is a classical manifestation of the SOS response (see under Discussion).
