Examination of toxR expression under different in vitro conditions using a transcriptional fusion reporter

ToxR is one of two proteins, along with TcpP, shown to activate the expression of ToxT, the master virulence activator in V. cholerae (Fig. 1).
The expression of tcpP has been shown to be induced by AphA and AphB [11,19], while toxR has been thought to be constitutively expressed and only modulated by temperature [16,18].
To measure toxR expression, we placed the toxR promoter upstream of the luxCDABE operon on a plasmid [20] and transformed into wild type V. cholerae.
We then grew the resulting cells at 37 degrees C or 22 degrees C. Expression of PtoxR-luxCDABE was significantly increased at 22 degrees C (Fig. 2A), consistent with the previous report [18] that the expression of toxR is modulated by temperatures.
Since the availability of oxygen concentrations is different during V. cholerae infection, we also examined the expression of toxR under varying oxygen concentrations (Fig. 2B).
The lux expression was similar under each condition, suggesting that oxygen levels do not regulate toxR expression.



Influence of virulence regulatory proteins on toxR expression

To investigate molecular influences on toxR expression, we introduced the PtoxR-lux construct into various strains of V. cholerae with mutations in virulence regulator genes.
We also included a tcpA mutant because a previous study showed that TcpA, the major subunit of TCP pilin [2], affects cholera toxin gene expression in vivo but not in vitro [21].
We grew these strains at 37 degrees C for 12 hours and measured luminescence (Fig. 3A).
We found that ToxR and ToxS did not affect toxR expression, indicating that ToxR does not autoregulate.
The expression of toxR in tcpPH, toxT, and tcpA mutants remained the same as that of wild type, but it was significantly decreased in aphA and aphB mutant strains (approximately 3- and 6-fold, respectively).
Of note, toxR expression in wild type and aphA or aphB mutants remained similar in the early and logarithmic phases of growth (data not shown).
We also examined toxR expression in wild type and various virulence regulatory mutants grown under the AKI condition [22], in which virulence genes are induced in El Tor strains of V. cholerae.
We found that toxR expression was decreased in both aphA and aphB mutants to a similar degree as those grown in LB medium (data not shown).
These data suggest that AphA and AphB may be important factors in increasing toxR expression during V. cholerae stationary growth.
These studies were confirmed by Western blot to examine ToxR protein levels (Fig. 3B): compared to those of wild type and other mutant strains, ToxR protein levels were notably decreased in the aphA and aphB mutants.
Interestingly, while toxR transcription was unchanged in toxS mutant (Fig. 3A), ToxR proteins were not detected in the absence of ToxS, suggesting that the ToxR effector ToxS may affect ToxR stability, at least in the stationary phase condition we tested.
Beck et al. reported that loss of ToxS had no measurable negative effect on steady-state levels of the ToxR protein at the mid-log phase growth [9].
The decreased ToxR expression at stationary phase in a toxS mutant is the subject of another investigation.



AphB directly regulates toxR expression

Knowing that full expression of ToxR required both AphA and AphB, we sought to determine which was directly responsible for this effect.
To this end, we placed aphA and aphB under control of an arabinose-inducible promoter and measured its effect on PtoxR-luxCDABE transcription in E. coli.
Overexpression of AphB, but not AphA, dramatically increased toxR transcription (Fig. 4A).
We currently do not know why in V. cholerae, both AphA and AphB are required to fully activate toxR expression, while in E. coli, only AphB can induce PtoxR-luxCDABE.
One possibility is that in V. cholerae, the expression of aphB is dependent on AphA.
However, we examined aphB expression in wild type and aphA mutant strains and did not detect any difference.
Another possibility is that AphA may indirectly activate ToxR expression through an intermediate which is absent in E. coli, or that AphA is required to repress an inhibitor of AphB that is present in V. cholera but not in E. coli.
AphA has been shown to regulate a number of other genes [23,24].
The activation of ToxR hinted at in this study may thus rely on the regulation of other members of the regulation cascade not yet elucidated.
We further confirmed AphB regulation of toxR in V. cholerae using a chromosomal transcriptional toxR-lacZ fusion (Fig. 4B).
We found that compared to that of wild type, toxR-lacZ expression was reduced in aphB mutants, while expression of aphB from a plasmid in this mutant restored toxR expression (Fig. 4B) and ToxR production (Fig. 4C).

To investigate whether AphB-mediated activation of toxR is direct or acts through another regulator present in E. coli, we purified AphB as an MBP (maltose-binding protein) fusion.
Recombinant AphB is functional, as it could activate tcpP transcription in E. coli (data not shown).
We then performed Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSA) using MBP-AphB and various lengths of toxR promoter DNA (Fig. 5A).
Fig. 5B shows that purified MBP-AphB was able to shift the two large toxR promoter fragments.
All of these mobility shifts could be inhibited by the addition of unlabeled specific DNA, indicating that the binding of AphB to these DNA sequences is specific (data not shown).
AphB was unable to shift the shortest toxR promoter fragment containing the 130 base pairs closest to the toxR translational start site, suggesting that the AphB binding site is located between 130 and 450 base pairs upstream of the toxR gene.
It has been reported that AphB binds and regulates tcpP and aphB promoter regions, and the AphB recognition sites in these promoters were identified [25].
We identified a similar putative AphB binding site in the toxR promoter region approximately 150 bp upstream of the toxR translational start (Fig. 5).
Further studies are required to test whether AphB protein binds this putative recognition site.
Consistent with the gel shift data, AphB could not induce toxR expression when the 130-bp fragment was fused with the luxCDABE reporter in E. coli (Fig. 5A).
Taken together, these data suggest that AphB directly regulates toxR expression.



The effects of AphB on ToxR-regulated genes

In addition to regulation of toxT, ToxR has been previously shown to alter the porin levels in V. cholerae by activating expression of ompU and repressing ompT [26,27].
Since we showed that AphB affects ToxR levels, we hypothesized that AphB might thus indirectly modulate the expression of ompU and ompT as well.
We performed SDS-PAGE on total protein extracts of wild type V. cholerae as well as toxR and aphB mutants.
As expected, the toxR strain had significantly lower OmpU and higher OmpT levels than in the wild-type strain.
Interestingly, the aphB mutant strain produced slightly higher levels of OmpT than wild type, though OmpU levels did not seem to change (Fig. 6A).
In addition, Provenzano et al. showed that ToxR-dependent modulation of outer membrane proteins enhances V. cholerae resistance to antimicrobial compounds such as bile salts and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) [28].
We confirmed that the toxR mutant strain had a reduced minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of SDS compared to wild type strains, but AphB did not affect the MBC of SDS (Fig. 6A).
Thus, AphB may only subtly modulate outer membrane porin expression through its effect on toxR expression.
This may be another downstream effect of AphB on the virulence capabilities of V. cholerae in addition to its better characterized influences on ToxT levels.
Moreover, as both ToxR and TcpP are required to activate toxT expression and AphB is required to activate tcpP expression (Fig. 1) [19,29], we tested whether AphB effects on toxR expression affect toxT expression under the AKI virulence induction condition [22].
As expected, toxT expression in aphB mutants was significantly reduced as compared to that of wild type (Fig. 6B), however, bypassing the AphB regulation of tcpP by constitutively expressing tcpPH (pBAD-tcpPH induced with 0.01% arabinose) restored toxT expression in aphB mutants.
These data suggest that AphB modulation of toxR expression has minor effects on virulence gene expression as compared to that of AphB regulation of tcpP under the condition we tested.
