Phylogeny of OpaR and its orthologs

The OpaR regulator shares high identity ( GTEQ 70%) in a.a. sequences with the orthologous MQSRs in other six Vibrio species tested (V. alginolyticus ValR, V. harveyi LuxR, V. vulnificus SmcR, V. tubiashii VtpR, V. anguillarum VanT, and V. cholerae HapR).
A phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) was constructed from the aligned a.a. sequences of the above seven orthologous MQSR proteins, with an additional regulator LitR from V. fischeri[28] as the outgroup (LitR has about 60% identity to the above seven MQSRs; all these eight proteins are belonged to the TetR-family DNA-binding regulators), which revealed that LuxR, OpaR, SmcR, and ValR constituted the most closely related group (>92% identity between each other).



The MQSR consensus

Since the four DNA-binding regulatory proteins LuxR, OpaR, SmcR, and ValR were extremely conserved, they should recognize the same conserved signals within their target promoters in V. harveyi, V. parahaemolyticus, V. vulnificus, and V. alginolyticus.
Known or predicted binding sites of LuxR, OpaR, SmcR, and ValR (Table 2) were collected, and then aligned to generate the MQSR consensus that manifested as a PFM (in which each row and column represents a position and a nucleotide, respectively) and as a 20 bp invert-repeat sequence TATTGATAAA-TTTATCAATA termed as the MQSR box (Fig. 3).

LuxR-dependent expression of its own gene [29], qrr2 - 4[7], and aphA[30] have been established in V. harveyi.
The presence of MQSR box-like sequences within the upstream DNA regions of the corresponding target genes in V. parahaemolyticus, as revealed by the computational promoter analysis (Table 2), indicated that the above regulatory cascades were conservatively controlled by the LuxR ortholog OpaR in V. parahaemolyticus, which were further validated by the following biochemical experiments.



Mutation and complementation of opaR

Real-time RT-PCR experiments were performed to assess the relative mRNA levels of opaR in WT, DeltaopaR, and C-opaR; the opaR transcript was lacking in DeltaopaR, but was restored in C-opaR relative to WT (data not shown), indicating the successful mutation of opaR and the complementation of the opaR mRNA level.

As determined by several distinct methods (see below), the ahpA gene was negatively regulated by OpaR.
To test whether the opaR mutation had the polar effect, the primer extension assays were conducted to detect the yield of the primer extension product of ahpA that represented the ahpA mRNA levels in WT, DeltaopaR, and C-opaR.
Herein, the ahpA mRNA level was significantly enhanced in DeltaopaR relative to WT, while no obvious change in the ahpA transcription was observed between WT and C-opaR (Fig. S1).
This analysis confirmed that the detecting enhanced transcription of ahpA in DeltaopaR was due to the opaR mutation rather than a polar effect.



Growth of WT and DeltaopaR

The growth curves of WT and DeltaopaR grown at 30 degrees C in the MR broth or in the HI broth were determined (Fig. 4).
The two strains showed indistinguishable growth rates in each of the media.
Thus, the opaR mutation had no effect on the bacterial in vitro growth.

For the following molecular regulation experiments, bacteria were pre-cultivated in the MR broth, spread onto grown on the HI agar plates for further growth, and harvested after an 8 h incubation at 30 degrees C [at this status, the dense bacterial lawns (i.e. HCD) were observed on the agar].
It was thought that, unlike the liquid cultivation for which the autoinducers would disperse into the liquid media, the cultivation on solid medium would enable the enrichment of autoinducer molecules within the bacterial lawns with little dispersal into the agar.



Negative auto-regulation of OpaR

The primer extension experiments (Fig. 5a) were conducted to compare the yields of primer extension product of opaR in WT and DeltaopaR.
The primer extension assay detected a single transcription start site located at 74 bp upstream of opaR; therefore, a single promoter was transcribed for opaR under the growth condition tested.
In addition, the opaR promoter activity was under the negative control of OpaR.
A 334 bp promoter-proximal region of opaR was amplified, radioactively labeled, and subjected to EMSA with a purified His-OpaR protein (Fig. 5b).
The results showed that His-OpaR was able to bind to this DNA fragment in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.
As further determined by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 5c), the purified His-OpaR protein protected two distinct regions upstream of opaR against DNase I digestion in a dose-dependent manner.
These two footprints, located from 70 to 40 bp (site 1) and from 159 to 109 bp (site 2) upstream of opaR, respectively, were considered as OpaR-binding sites.
Taken together, OpaR is able to recognize the promoter of its own gene to directly repress its activity in V. parahaemolyticus.



Stimulation of qrr2 - 4 by OpaR

The primer extension assay (Fig. 6a) defined the transcription start sites the three sRNA genes qrr2 - 4, and this assay also indicated that the promoter activity of all the thee qrr genes was under the positive control of OpaR.
Each of the promoter-proximal regions of qrr2 - 4 was subjected to EMSA with the purified His-OpaR protein (Fig. 6b).
The results showed that His-OpaR was able to bind to each of the three DNA fragments tested in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.
As further determined by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 6c), His-OpaR protected a single region within each of the three upstream DNA fragments tested against DNase I digestion in a dose-dependent manner.
These footprints, located from 172 to 143 bp, from 154 to 125 bp, and from 204 to 133 bp upstream of qrr2 - 4, respectively, were considered as OpaR-binding sites for these three genes.
Taken together, OpaR is able to recognize the promoters of qrr2 - 4 to activate their activity in V. parahaemolyticus.



Repression of aphA by OpaR

The primer extension assay (Fig. 7a) detected two closely neighboring extension products for aphA.
Due to the facts that the shorter extension product might represent the premature stops due to the difficulty of polymerase in passing difficult sequences, and that the core promoter elements recognized by sigma factors could not be identified for the shorter extension product, only the longer product was chosen for the identification of the transcription start site that was located at 200 bp upstream of aphA.
Therefore, a single promoter was transcribed for aphA under the growth condition tested, and its activity was under the negative control of OpaR.
A 541 bp promoter-proximal region of aphA was subjected to EMSA with the purified His-OpaR protein (Fig. 7b).
The results showed that His-OpaR was able to bind to the DNA fragment in a dose-dependent manner in vitro.
As further determined by DNase I footprinting (Fig. 7c), His-OpaR protected a single region from 284 to 255 bp upstream of opaR against DNase I digestion in a dose-dependent manner.
This footprint was considered as the OpaR-binding site for aphA.
Taken together, OpaR is able to recognize the promoter of aphA to repress its activity in V. parahaemolyticus.
