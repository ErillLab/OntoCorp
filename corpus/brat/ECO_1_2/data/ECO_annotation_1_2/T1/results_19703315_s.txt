The sycO, ypkA and yopJ genes constitute a single operon

The RT-PCR assay indicated that the sycO, ypkA and yopJ genes (designated as pCD12, pCD13 and pCD14 in Y. pestis 91001 [19], respectively) were transcribed as a single primary RNA (Fig. 1), and thereby these three genes constituted a single operon in Y. pestis Microtus strain 201.



CRP greatly represses transcription of the sycO-ypkA-yopJ operon

Our previous cDNA microarray analysis showed that the transcription of sycO, ypkA and yopJ was repressed by CRP [4].
Herein, the real-time RT-PCR assays confirmed that these three genes were up-regulated by more than 50 folds in the Deltacrp mutant in relative to the WT strain (Fig. 2).
Taken together, transcription of the sycO-ypkA-yopJ operon was under the negative control of CRP.



CRP greatly represses promoter activity of sycO-ypkA-yopJ

To test the action of CRP on the sycO-ypkA-yopJ promoter activity, we constructed the sycO::lacZ fusion promoter consisting of a 690 bp promoter-proximate region of sycO and promoterless lacZ, and then transformed into the WT and Deltacrp, respectively.
Empty vector pRS551 was also introduced into them, respectively, as controls.
beta-galactosidase activity was measured for evaluating the sycO-ypkA-yopJ promoter activity in each strain.
Since the crp mutation had an effect on the copy number of recombinant or empty pRS551 plasmid [4], a normalized fold change in the activity of each fusion promoter in WT in relative to Deltacrp was calculated to avoid the influence of copy number of pRS551 (Table 2).

Accordingly, the beta-galactosidase activity in the Deltacrp increased compared to the WT when they grew in the 'TMH-1mM cAMP' medium, indicating that CRP greatly repressed the promoter activity of sycO-ypkA-yopJ (Table 2).



CRP binds to promoter-proximate region of sycO-ypkA-yopJ

A CRP box-like sequence was found in the promoter-proximate region of sycO-ypkA-yopJ [4], indicating the direct association of CRP with the sycO-ypkA-yopJ promoter region.
Further EMSA experiments showed that the cAMP-CRP complex bound to the sycO-ypkA-yopJ promoter region in a CRP dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3a).
CRP could not bind to the target DNA in the absence of cAMP.

To validate the specificity of CRP-DNA interaction, YPO0180 and YPO1099 [gene IDs in CO92 [20]] were used as negative controls (Fig. 3b).
The PCR-generated upstream DNA of YPO0180 did not harbor the predicted CRP binding site, while the YPO1099 upstream region gave an extremely low score value of 0.96 during the pattern matching analysis using the CRP consensus (sycO gave a score value of 8.57) [4].
Both of them gave negative EMSA result, even the CRP protein was increased to 4 mug in a single reaction mixture (Fig. 3b).

Therefore, CRP specifically bound to the sycO-ypkA-yopJ promoter region and directly repressed the transcription of sycO-ypkA-yopJ.



Structural organization of CRP-dependent sycO-ypkA-yopJ promoter

In order to locate the precise CRP binding site within the sycO-ypkA-yopJ promoter region, DNase I footprinting assay was performed with both coding and non-coding strands.
As shown in Fig. 4, CRP protected two distinct DNA regions (sites 1 and 2) against DNase I digestion in a dose-dependent pattern.
Only site 1 contained the CRP box-like sequence.

The transcription start site of sycO was determined by primer extension assay.
A single primer extension product was detected and thus a single CRP-dependent promoter was transcribed for sycO-ypkA-yopJ (Fig. 5).
Compared to the WT, a much stronger primer extension product was detected in the Deltacrp.
Since the yield of primer extension product would indicate the mRNA expression level of sycO in each strain, data presented here confirmed the repression of sycO-ypkA-yopJ by CRP.

The primer extension results could be also employed to map the 5' terminus of RNA transcript for sycO (i.e. the transcription start site of sycO-ypkA-yopJ) (Fig. 6).
The -10 and -35 core promoter elements were predicted accordingly.

The determination of CRP-binding sites, transcription start site, and core promoter element (-10 and -35 regions) promoted us to depict the structural organization of CRP-dependent promoter, giving a map of CRP-promoter DNA interaction for sycO-ypkA-yopJ (Fig. 6).
