Promoter deletion series delineates the protein-binding site within the crhR gene

EMSA assays were performed using nine plasmid constructs containing deletions of the crhR promoter (Figure 1A) to delineate the protein-binding region.
Intact crhR promoter (KC-179) and deletions up to position +77 of the crhR transcript (KC+77) exhibited decreased mobility on a native PAGE gel upon incubation with Synechocystis protein extract (Figure 1B, lanes 1 - 14).
The KC+125 DNA target, deleted to +125 of the transcript, exhibited a reduced amount of shift (Figure 1B, lanes 15 and 16), while deletion to +219 completely abolished the mobility shift (Figure 1B, lanes 17 and 18).
Together, these results indicate that the protein-binding site is located downstream of the translational start codon (+110) in the region of DNA surrounding an SpeI site (+125).
Sequence specificity of binding was shown by competition assays in the presence of increasing amounts of either specific or non-specific competitor DNA (Figure 1C).
Addition of specific competitor DNA (KC-179) progressively challenged formation of the shifted complex (Figure 1C, Specific competitor).
Conversely, inclusion of a similar sized fragment containing the pBluescript KS+ multiple cloning site had no effect on the mobility shift (Figure 1C, non-specific competitor).
Taken together, these results indicate that at least one soluble Synechocystis protein interacts with the crhR gene in a sequence-specific manner.



Synechocystis LexA-related protein binds within the crhR ORF

To identify the protein responsible for altered mobility of the crhR gene, DNA affinity column chromatography was performed using light-grown Synechocystis soluble protein extracts and biotinylated KC+5 DNA (239 bp).
A single polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 28 kDa was recovered in the high stringency 1 M KCl elution (Figure 2A).
The single significant hit (score 92) identified by in-gel tryptic digestion and LC/MS/MS corresponded to the Synechocystis gene sll1626, which has been annotated as encoding the transcriptional repressor LexA ().
Analysis of the deduced Synechocystis LexA amino acid sequence revealed that the sequence lacks the Ala-Gly self-cleavage site and the serine of the Ser-Lys dyad active site present in E.coli LexA, both of which are required for LexA self-cleavage [Figure 2B; (31)].
Furthermore, an SOS-like box, similar to those identified as LexA binding sites in E.coli (32,33), Bacillus subtilis (34) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (35) could not be identified within the upstream sequence of either lexA or crhR (data not shown).
However, a sequence related to the putative cyanobacterial SOS box (36), matching 7 of 9 essential residues with required spacing between essential residues, was identified within the protein-binding domain in crhR (Figure 2C).
This sequence includes the SpeI site, possibly explaining the reduced shift observed with the SpeI generated KC+125 fragment (Figure 1B).



Synechocystis lexA, crhR and recA transcript accumulation

crhR transcript accumulation is regulated by the redox poise of the plastoquinone pool with treatments leading to reduction of plastoquinone correlating with an increase in crhR transcript accumulation, whereas conditions that lead to the oxidation of the plastoquinone pool result in decreased crhR accumulation (1).
Northern analysis was therefore performed to determine the relationship between lexA and crhR transcript accumulation under varying redox conditions (Figure 3A).
Growth in the light (Figure 3A, lane 1), conditions favoring crhR transcript accumulation, correlate with reduced levels of lexA transcript.
Conversely, growth in the dark (Figure 3A, lane 2) reduces crhR while enhancing lexA transcript accumulation.
The addition of glucose (5 mM) to light-grown cells enhanced crhR and lexA transcript accumulation (Figure 3A, lane 3).
crhR expression was significantly induced in response to cold stress (20 degrees C; Figure 3A, lane 4), concomitant with the complete repression of lexA transcript accumulation.
The data indicates differential regulation of crhR and lexA expression in response to alterations in the redox status of the electron transport chain, implying that LexA functions as a regulator of crhR expression.

LexA association with the E.coli SOS response and repression of DNA damage repair gene expression warranted comparative analysis of Synechocystis lexA, recA and crhR expression in response to DNA damage.
DNA damage was induced by UV-irradiation, and the resulting expression patterns were examined by northern analysis (Figure 3B).
In contrast to E.coli, following UV-irradiation neither Synechocystis lexA nor recA expression (Figure 3B, lanes 2 - 4) was induced above basal levels detected in dark grown cells (Figure 3B, lane 1).
In fact, in contrast to other prokaryotic systems, recA was expressed at very low levels under all conditions tested, requiring riboprobe detection and extended exposure times.
lexA transcript accumulation was also not altered by DNA damage-induced by mitomycin C (data not shown).
Similarly, expression of crhR was not UV-inducible (data not shown); rather, it followed the expected decrease in transcription that occurs in wild-type cells in the dark (1).
The lack of induction of the Synechocystis recA, lexA and crhR genes following DNA damage suggests these gene products are not required during the cellular response to DNA damage.



Synechocystis LexA interacts with the crhR gene

Recombinant His-tagged LexA (rLexA) was purified to near homogeneity and used to test interaction with the KC+5 crhR promoter fragment (Figure 4).
KC+5 crhR promoter DNA mobility was reduced by incubation with total Synechocystis protein extracts (Figure 4A, lane 8 versus lane 1).
Mobility of the KC+5 DNA target was also altered by incubation with purified rLexA, with alteration of target DNA mobility exhibiting rLexA concentration dependence (Figure 4A, lanes 2 - 7).
E.coli soluble protein extracts did not alter crhR DNA target mobility, indicating that E.coli proteins do not bind the crhR gene (Figure 4A, lane 9).
Sequence-specific binding was demonstrated by competition assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of either specific or non-specific competitor DNA.
Addition of unlabeled specific competitor (KC+5) challenged formation of the shifted complex at all concentrations tested (Figure 4B, lanes 2 - 5), with addition of GTEQ 50-fold excess of unlabeled target abolishing shift of the DNA target.
In contrast, incubation with non-specific competitor DNA, an internal lexA fragment similar in size to the specific competitor, did not significantly alter mobility shift at comparable concentrations (Figure 4B, lanes 7 - 10).
Together, the results indicate that recombinant LexA interacts with the crhR gene in a sequence-specific manner.



LexA represses crhR gene expression in vitro

An in vitro transcription and translation system was used to confirm LexA regulation of crhR gene expression from its native promoter.
As shown in Figure 5A, CrhR protein accumulation decreased in response to increasing rLexA concentration.
Quantification of these results indicated that the rLexA inhibition of CrhR expression was linear with respect to rLexA concentration (Figure 5B).
The specificity of repression was demonstrated by the lack of change in the levels of the plasmid-encoded beta-lactamase protein, a non-LexA regulated protein.
Similarly, crhR expression was unaffected by incubation in the presence of 1 pmol BSA (Figure 5C), a protein concentration at which rLexA significantly altered crhR expression.
Furthermore, in vitro transcription and translation of a second cyanobacterial RNA helicase, crhC (29,30), was also unaffected by 1 pmol rLexA (Figure 5C).
Together, these results indicate that LexA specifically regulates crhR transcription in a negative fashion.
