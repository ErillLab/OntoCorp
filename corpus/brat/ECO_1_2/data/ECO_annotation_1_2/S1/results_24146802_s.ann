T1	ECO 965 989	proteins were identified
A1	Category T1 Phen
A2	ECOConfidence T1 Low
A3	NextSentence T1 Yes
A4	AssertionStrength T1 Medium
N1	Reference T1 brat_eco:ECO:0001118	protein sequencing assay evidence
#1	AnnotatorNotes T1	Annotated by Stephen. Protein sequencing is going on here, but I don't know if "proteins were identified" is enough to go on without outside context.
T2	ECO 5404 5426	EMSAs were carried out
A5	Category T2 MolFn
A6	ECOConfidence T2 High
A7	NextSentence T2 Yes
A8	AssertionStrength T2 Low
N2	Reference T2 brat_eco:ECO:0000096	electrophoretic mobility shift assay evidence
#2	AnnotatorNotes T2	Annotated by Stephen. The assertion is a little weak, but I think it's still worth annotating. 
T3	ECO 5657 5723	consensus DNA motif for binding of the BCARR protein was predicted
A9	Category T3 SeqFeat
A10	ECOConfidence T3 High
A11	NextSentence T3 No
A12	AssertionStrength T3 Medium
N3	Reference T3 brat_eco:ECO:0005532	consensus search evidence
#3	AnnotatorNotes T3	Annotated by Stephen. I picked medium confidence just because it said "predicted" (even though I know everything in bioinformatics is mostly a prediction). Question: should I also annotate the reference to MEME?
T4	ECO 6007 6046	predicted to be the BCARR binding motif
A13	Category T4 SeqFeat
A14	ECOConfidence T4 High
A15	NextSentence T4 No
A16	AssertionStrength T4 Medium
N4	Reference T4 brat_eco:ECO:0005531	motif discovery evidence
#4	AnnotatorNotes T4	Annotated by Stephen. I picked discovery over similarity since the sentence does not state that this is a conserved motif previously observed.
T5	ECO 9532 9553;9593 9626	Phylogenetic analysis revealed the presence of homologs
A17	Category T5 Tax
A18	ECOConfidence T5 High

T6	ECO 7857 7884	the BCARR protein protected
A21	Category T6 MolFn
N6	Reference T6 brat_eco:ECO:0000136	nucleic acid binding evidence
A22	ECOConfidence T6 Low
A23	AssertionStrength T6 Medium
#6	AnnotatorNotes T6	Annotated by Stephen. I chose low since just the word "protected" doesn't really say a whole lot. 
T7	ECO 8550 8573;8636 8704	a possible domain motif protein was predicted (131 - 235 aa) by PSI-BLAST homology searching

A27	AssertionStrength T7 High
N7	Reference T7 brat_eco:ECO:0000208	protein BLAST evidence
#7	AnnotatorNotes T7	Annotated by Stephen. Protein sequencing falls under sequence feature, right?
