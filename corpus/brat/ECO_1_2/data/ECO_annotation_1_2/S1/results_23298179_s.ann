T1	ECO 2796 2825	Hybridizations with total RNA
A1	Category T1 SeqFeat
A2	ECOConfidence T1 High
A3	NextSentence T1 No
A4	AssertionStrength T1 Low
N1	Reference T1 brat_eco:ECO:0000059	experimental phenotypic evidence
#1	AnnotatorNotes T1	Annotated by Stephen. I had no clue what to label this as, so I picked experimental phenotypic. I cannot find a term for hybridization of RNA with RNA in the ontology.
T2	ECO 3396 3454	supported by the lack of an identifiable separate promoter
A5	Category T2 SeqFeat
A6	ECOConfidence T2 Medium
A7	NextSentence T2 No
A8	AssertionStrength T2 Medium
N2	Reference T2 brat_eco:ECO:0005532	consensus search evidence
#2	AnnotatorNotes T2	Annotated by Stephen. This sentence is weirdly-phrased but I'm pretty confident in this annotation.
T3	ECO 3470 3532	by the finding of a putative strong transcriptional terminator
A9	Category T3 SeqFeat
A10	ECOConfidence T3 Medium
A11	NextSentence T3 No
A12	AssertionStrength T3 Medium
N3	Reference T3 brat_eco:ECO:0005531	motif discovery evidence
#3	AnnotatorNotes T3	Annotated by Stephen. I'm less confident about this one, but I think they're definitely using this to support their claim so I figured it was worth annotating.
T4	ECO 6592 6622	intensity of the retarded band
A13	Category T4 MolFn
A14	ECOConfidence T4 Medium
A15	NextSentence T4 Yes
A16	AssertionStrength T4 High
N4	Reference T4 brat_eco:ECO:0000096	electrophoretic mobility shift assay evidence
#4	AnnotatorNotes T4	Annotated by Stephen. I think this is pretty cut and dry, annotated for molecular function- DNA binding.
