MtrA interacted with the regulatory region of the M. tuberculosis dnaA gene

Bacterial one-hybrid assays confirmed the interaction between MtrA and the regulatory sequence of the dnaA initiator gene.
The dnaA promoter region was cloned into the reporter genes upstream of HIS3-aadA and the reporter vector pBXcmT (Fig. 1A).
As shown in Fig. 1B, the co-transformant strain with the dnaA promoter and MtrA was observed to grow well on the screening medium.
In contrast, there was no growth for the strain containing either MtrA or the dnaA promoter alone.
In addition, neither the co-transformant strain containing an unrelated DNA, SsoDNA (Additional file 1), nor MtrA did grew, indicating that this DNA cannot interact with MtrA (Fig. 1B).
Thus, MtrA specifically interacted with the dnaA gene promoter.

The interaction of the purified MtrA protein with the dnaA promoter was confirmed by the interaction with the DNA on the chip.
As shown in Fig. 1C, the biotinylated promoter DNA was first associated with the streptavidin (SA) chip (GE Healthcare).
When an increasing concentration of MtrA protein (100-500 nM) was passed over the chip surface, a corresponding increasing response value was observed.
This again indicated that the MtrA protein could bind with the dnaA promoter DNA (Fig. 1C).
In contrast, heated inactive protein showed no response when it was passed over the chip (Fig. 1C).
When an unspecific DNA, the promoter of Rv0467, was coated on the chip, no significant association for MtrA was observed (Additional file 2).
In a further confirmatory experiment, 200 muM unlabeled promoter DNA was also added along with the MtrA protein.
This DNA competed with that on the chip for the available MtrA; here, a significantly lower response was observed compared to a control with no competition (Fig. 1D).



Characterization of the DNA-box motif in the dnaA promoter that allows MtrA binding

Several short DNA fragments (S1-S5) were used to precisely determine the DNA-box motif for the MtrA in this promoter region (Fig. 2A).
As shown in Fig. 2B, a specific protein/DNA complex was observed on S1, S2, and S5, indicating that MtrA could recognize these DNA substrates.
In contrast, no binding activity was observed for substrates S3 and S4, both of which lacked the 5-CACGCCG-3 or 5-CACGAGG-3 sequence box (Fig. 2A).
Further confirmation of the specific interaction was obtained by conducting the competing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay with the unlabeled DNA fragments.
As shown in Additional file 3, a significantly lower response was observed when either the unlabeled S2 or S5 was added together with MtrA, which indicated that they could compete the binding of MtrA with the promoter DNA on the chip.
Therefore, these two sequence motifs appeared to be essential for the MtrA binding with the dnaA regulatory region.

The interaction between MtrA and these two sequence boxes was further confirmed by DNase I footprinting assays (Fig. 3).
Regions that contain these two boxes were significantly protected when MtrA was present.
Protection at S6 occurred at all MtrA concentrations while the protection of S7 was dependent on the concentration of MtrA.
This suggests that MtrA has different binding affinities with these regions.

We characterized two sequence boxes for the recognition of MtrA within the dnaA promoter, situated immediately downstream of promoters P1 and P2.
The binding sequence boxes and their situation within the dnaA promoter are summarized in Fig. 2C.



Characterization of potential target genes regulated by MtrA in mycobacterial genomes

We searched the intergenic regions of the M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis genomes extensively based on the two sequence motifs for MtrA in the dnaA gene promoter region.
To validate the target genes, several regulatory regions of the genes were amplified.
The DNA-binding activities of MtrA were examined using EMSA assays.
As shown in Fig. 4, the regulatory sequence of a predicted target gene, isoniazid inducible gene iniB (rv0341), could be recognized by MtrA.
A specific DNA/protein complex band was also observed.
In addition, MtrA was able to bind with two target promoter DNA sequences of Rv0574 (a hypothetical protein) and Rv3476 (KgtP), producing a corresponding DNA/protein band (Fig. 4A).
The positive target DNA was shown to bind with MtrA, while the negative DNA was not.
The 7 bp sequence motif could also be found in the promoter regions of two previously characterized target genes, CgmepA and CgproP, in C. glutamicum.
Interestingly, M. tuberculosis MtrA bound with the regulatory sequences and produced specific shifted bands (Fig. 4A).

A further logo assay for the consensus sequence was conducted using the WebLogo tool [16].
A more general conserved motif for MtrA recognition was mapped out (Fig. 4B).
In all, 155 potential target genes were characterized from the M. tuberculosis genome (Additional file 4), and 264 genes were characterized from the M. smegmatis genome (Additional file 5).



Effects of mtrA gene expression level on mycobacterial drug resistance and cell morphology

The mRNA antisense expression of the mtrA gene in M. smegmatis showed a regulatory effect of mtrA on mycobacterial drug resistance and cell morphology [17].
No substantial change was observed for the general growth of the recombinant mycobacterial strains.
However, as shown in Fig. 5A, the recombinant mycobacterial cells became sensitive to the anti-TB drugs isoniazid and streptomycin, as evidenced by their inhibited growth in the presence of 25 mug/mL of isoniazid or 0.5 mug/mL of streptomycin in the medium.
In contrast, no noticeable inhibition was observed for two other drugs, ethambutol and rifampicinB (data not shown).
With a general growth of the recombinant mycobacterial strains resulting in minimal change, the cell morphology was further examined using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique.
As shown in Fig. 5B, the cell lengthened when 20 ng/mL tetracycline was added to the medium to induce expression of the antisense mtrA mRNA (right panel).

When relative gene expression was measured via qRT-PCR as shown in Fig. 5C, the mtrA gene was only 0.38-fold that of the wild-type strain, indicating that the expression of the mtrA gene in recombinant M. smegmatis was greatly inhibited.
The expression of the dnaA gene in the recombinant strain basically remained constant when compared with that in the wild-type strain.
This was consistent with the fact that no conserved sequence motif existed within the regulatory region of this gene in M. smegmatis.
Another approximately 26 potential target genes were randomly chosen to measure the expression change in the recombinant M. smegmatis strain (Fig. 5C).
The expression levels of these genes clearly changed; iniA and mtrB gene expression increased 2.5-fold expression (Fig. 5C), while mraZ (Msmeg_4236) and rpfB (Msmeg_5439) gene expression decreased by about 0.2-fold (Fig. 5C).

Therefore, the inhibition of the mtrA gene resulted in corresponding expression changes in many predicted target genes in M. smegmatis.
The expression level of the mtrA gene consequently affected the drug resistance and cell morphology of M. smegmatis.
