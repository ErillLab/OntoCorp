ZurPA is Highly Similar to Zur Found in Other Bacteria

If the protein encoded by np20 is the P. aeruginosa Zur, it would be expected to share sequence similarity with Zur proteins found in other bacteria.
To address this, we aligned and compared the amino acid sequence of the putative ZurPA with that of Zur proteins previously characterized in other bacteria (Figure 1).
As can be seen in Figure 1, ZurPA has high sequence identity with other Zur proteins.
It has greater than 40% identity with the Zur protein from the gram-negative bacteria examined and 45% similarity (31% identity) with FurB from M. tuberculosis (data not shown).
ZurPA also shares several regions of conserved sequences with the other Zur proteins (indicated by the black shading).
In addition to containing the first Zur specific sequence, a highly conserved putative DNA-binding region from amino acids 76 to 92, ZurPA also has two conserved zinc binding domains.
The double cysteine-X-X-cysteine motif found in C118XXC121-X36-C158XXC161 is completely conserved in all characterized Zur proteins and is highly conserved throughout the Fur-like protein family [13].
This site corresponds to the structural zinc binding C-site described in other Zur proteins.
The other highly conserved site, which includes two histidine residues in the H109 SH111 motif and the highly conserved C104 is indicative of the M-site, which is a zinc sensing site [13].
Zinc interaction with the M-site and portions of the DNA-binding site alters Zur confirmation and allows for DNA binding.
The occurrence of the putative C and M zinc binding sites in ZurPA and the high overall similarity between ZurPA and Zur proteins from other bacteria strongly suggested that the protein encoded by np20 is the P. aeruginosa Zur (ZurPA).



zur is in an Operon Which Encodes Components of the Putative ZnuABC System

We next set out to determine the genetic organization of the operon containing the zur gene.
The annotation provided at www.Pseudomonas.com suggested that zur was the first gene in a three gene operon.
The genes predicted to be transcribed within the zur operon include homologs of the E. coli znuC (61% identity) and znuB (60% identity).
Using reverse transcription-PCR, we found that primers designed to span the intergenic regions between zur and the znuC homolog, as well as znuC and znuB homolog each generated a PCR product (Figure 2A).
This indicated that these genes were transcribed on the same mRNA.
Interestingly, primers spanning the 42 bp intergenic region between the putative znuB and a hypothetical gene, PA5502, did not give a product, suggesting that gene PA5502 is not part of the zur operon, despite its proximal location to the zur-znuC-znuB operon.
As expected, primers spanning the 70 bp intergenic region between zur and the divergently transcribed gene PA5498, which shares 60% sequence similarity with the E. coli znuA (identified as znuA in Figure 2A), did not generate a product.
These data suggested that zur forms an operon with two of the three genes which encode components of a probable ZnuABC zinc uptake system, further implicating the involvement of ZurPA with the zinc uptake system.
A schematic representation of the Zur operon is shown in Figure 2B.



Loss of the Putative ZnuA, ZnuB, and ZnuC Effects Growth in Low Zinc Conditions

The similarity of the genes transcribed in the P. aeruginosa zur operon to genes in E. coli that encode components of the ZnuABC transport system strongly suggest the P. aeruginosa homologs would have a similar function.
However, many ATPase metal transport systems share high sequence similarities and yet do not transport the same metals.
In order to test if the P. aeruginosa putative znuA, znuB, and znuC genes may be involved in zinc uptake, we constructed deletion mutants of the putative genes PAO-ZnA (DeltaznuA), PAO-ZnB (DeltaznuB), and PAO-ZnC (DeltaznuC), then grew the strains in zinc deplete conditions.
As seen in Figure 3, the inability to express the putative znuA, znuB, or znuC genes resulted in decreased growth at 18 hours as compared wild-type strain PAO1 when the strains were grown in LB media supplemented with 0.5 mM EDTA.
The growth defects were not severe (29.6% less growth in strain PAO-ZnA, 14.6% less growth in strain PAO-ZnB, and 14.1% less growth in strain PAO-ZnC as compared to wild-type strain PAO1), yet they were found to be statistically significant.
The ability to grow at all in low zinc can be attributed to P. aeruginosa possessing low affinity zinc permeases (such as HmtA) that can uptake the metal in the absence of a functional ZnuABC transporter.
Because these mutants have decreased growth in low zinc conditions compared to wild-type strain PAO1, and the genes have high sequence similarity to the corresponding genes in E. coli, these data support the idea that these genes encode the ZnuABC transporter.

To confirm that the mutation of the putative znuA, znuB, or znuC genes did not cause a general growth defect, we analyzed the growth kinetics of strains PAO1, PAO-ZnA, PAO-ZnB, and PAO-ZnC grown in LB media (see Figure S1).
None of the mutant strains showed growth defects when grown in zinc replete conditions.



Loss of Np20 (Zur) Results in an Accumulation of Intracellular Zinc

If Np20 is the P. aeruginosa Zur, then it should repress zinc uptake in high zinc conditions.
Thus, loss of the protein should result in a higher accumulation of intracellular zinc compared to a wild-type strain.
To test this hypothesis, we grew strains PAO1 and PAO-Zur in high zinc conditions and then determined the intracellular zinc content by ICP-AES.
Our results, shown in Figure 4, show that loss of Zur in strain PAO-Zur results in a 15.6% increase of intracellular zinc compared to wild-type strain PAO1 (0.0435 +- 0.006 mg zinc / g-1 dry PAO-Zur cell weight versus 0.0367 +- 0.002 mg zinc / g-1 dry PAO1 cell weight).
Zinc accumulation inside the PAO-Zur strain did not reach toxic levels, more than likely a result of the activation of zinc efflux systems.
However, the results support the notion that Np20 is the P. aeruginosa Zur (ZurPA) and controls zinc uptake in this bacterium.



Transcription of znuA is Under the Control of ZurPA in a Zinc-Dependent Manner

To determine the role of ZurPA on znuA transcription, we constructed two reporter strains, PAO1.znuA'-lacZ and PAO-Zur.znuA'-lacZ, which contain a znuA'-lacZ transcriptional fusion on their chromosomes in a neutral, non-mutational site.
The strains were grown to mid-log phase in modified media supplemented with increasing ZnCl2 concentrations, and beta-gal activity was measured.
As seen in Figure 5A, znuA transcription was virtually the same for both strains when grown in low zinc media (204 +- 4 vs. 208 +- 13 Miller units).
However, the addition of 1microM ZnCl2 greatly decreased znuA'-lacZ activity in strain PAO1.znuA'-lacZ to 61 +- 5 Miller units while it had virtually no effect on znuA'-lacZ activity in strain PAO-Zur.znuA'-lacZ (197 +- 24) (Figure 5A).
Transcription of znuA in strain PAO1.znuA'-lacZ decreased step-wise as the ZnCl2 concentrations increased, dropping by greater than 10-fold from M-LB (204 +- 4 to 18 +- 4 Miller units) to M-LB plus 1 mM ZnCl2 (Figure 5A).
Transcription of znuA in strain PAO-Zur.znuA'-lacZ remained relatively unchanged before dropping 35% when ZnCl2 concentration reached 1 mM, indicating that ZurPA is required for a response to zinc.
Expression of ZurPA on plasmid pZur in strain PAO-Zur.znuA'-lacZ when the strain was grown in GTEQ 100 microM zinc resulted in a drop in Miller units to 15.7 +- 7, which mirrors the Miller Units for strain PAO1.znuA'-lacZ grown under the same conditions (data not shown).

To confirm the beta-galactosidase assay results, we performed real time RT-PCR.
We compared expression levels of znuA in strain PAO1 and PAO-Zur grown in M-LB supplemented with 1 mM ZnCl2.
Using the house keeping gene rplU to standardize the comparison, we found that znuA expression was 5.7 +- 1.8 fold higher in strain PAO-Zur than in strain PAO1 when grown in high zinc (data not shown).
The fold difference is similar to the 7.5 fold difference in Miller Units between observed between the znuA'-lacZ reporter strains.
Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that ZurPA repressed znuA transcription in a zinc dependent manner.
They also further suggest that ZnuABC was involved in Zn(II) homeostasis.



ZurPA Autoregulates its Own Transcription

Because the intergenic region between znuA and zur is only 70 bp, we speculated that ZurPA may also regulate its own transcription.
To test this, we constructed a chromosomal zur'-lacZ transcriptional fusion reporter, introduced it into a neutral site in strains PAO1 and PAO-Zur, and measured beta-galactosidase activity.
As with the znuA'-lacZ fusion grown in M-LB, transcription of zur in both strains was similar (1368 +- 191 Miller units vs. 1607 +- 182 Miller units; Figure 5B).
However, when the strains were grown in the presence of increasing concentrations of ZnCl2, zur transcription was repressed in a step-wise manner in strain PAO1, dropping to 589 +- 96 Miller units when grown in 1000 microM ZnCl2 (Figure 5B).
Transcription of zur remained virtually unchanged in strain PAO-Zur.zur'-lacZ regardless of the zinc concentration in the media.
Overexpression of ZurPA on plasmid pZur in PAO-Zur.zur'-lacZ in the presence of excess zinc resulted in almost full complementation of zur repression (798 +- 180 Miller units in PAO-Zur.zur'-lacZ (pZur) versus 705 +- 58 Miller units in strain PAO1.zur'-lacZ) when both strains were grown in M-LB plus 100 microM ZnCl2 (data not shown).
These data support the notion that ZurPA represses transcription of its own operon in response to increases in zinc concentration.



ZurPA Directly Interacts with the znuA Promoter

The above data suggested that ZurPA represses znuA transcription in a zinc-dependent manner; however it was not clear if it does so directly.
To test whether ZurPA directly or indirectly regulates the expression of znuA, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).
Recombinant Strep-tagged ZurPA (rZur) was expressed and purified from E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (prZur) and used in EMSA experiments.
P. aeruginosa rZur bound specifically to the 198 bp fragment which contains the znuA promoter in intergenic region spanning between znuA and zur (Figure 6).
The ability of rZur to bind the promoter depended on the availability of free zinc in the buffer reaction.
The addition of TPEN, a zinc specific chelator, to the binding reaction rendered rZur unable to bind to the promoter.
These findings show that Zn2+ can modulate the binding activity of P. aeruginosa Zur to DNA and further support the notion that ZurPA serves as a zinc-responsive transcriptional repressor of znuA and zur-znuCB.
