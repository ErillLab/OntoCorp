IHF is Required for orp1 and orp2 Transcription

It was previously shown that the two divergent orp operons require the sigma54 RNA polymerase and the cognate transcriptional EBP, DVU2106, to achieve transcription [6].
It is well described that DNA bending allowing contacts between the cognate activator and sigma54-RNA polymerase to activate transcription is usually facilitated by the heterodimeric IHF protein.
To test the contribution of IHF to the expression of these genes, the previously described orp1, orp2 and DVU2106 promoter-lacZ transcription fusions were introduced into the heterologous host E. coli.
Expression of these promoter-lacZ fusions were examined in both IHF-proficient (wild-type) and IHF-deficient (DeltaihfA) strains that produced the transcriptional regulator DVU2106 from a compatible multicopy plasmid (Figure 1A - D).
The expression of DVU2106, controlled by the sigma70-RNA polymerase, was not influenced by the absence of IHF (Figure 1C).
By contrast, the activities of the orp1 and orp2 promoters, under the control of the sigma54-RNA polymerase, were significantly affected by the absence of IHF as the orp1'::lacZ and orp2'::lacZ expression levels decreased 10 - 12 fold compared to the wild-type strain producing IHF (Figure 1B and 1D).
These results show that the E. coli IHF heterodimer can activate orp operons transcription and that IHF is required for the expression of these sigma54-dependent operons.



The E. coli IHF Protein Binds to the Promoter Regions of orp1 and orp2

To address whether IHF can bind to these promoters, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA).
32P-labeled orp1 and orp2 promoter fragments were incubated with increasing concentrations of purified E. coli IHF heterodimers.
As shown in Figure 2, the two DNA fragments were specifically retarded in presence of GTEQ 4 nM of IHF.
These data demonstrate that the IHF protein interacts with the promoter regions of the orp1 and orp2 operons.



Identification of the Functional IHF Binding Sites

In silico analyses of the intergenic region of the orp cluster using the Virtual Footprint program (http://prodoric.tu-bs.de/vfp/vfp_promoter.php) suggested the presence of two potential IHF binding sites within the orp1 promoter (called hereafter IHF1 and IHF2) located at positions -42 and -79, respectively, from the transcriptional start site of orp1 (Figures 3 and S1) and one potential binding site for IHF within the orp2 promoter, located at position -43 from the transcriptional start site of orp2 (Figures 3 and S1).
The orp1 IHF1 site (AATCAGAATAAA) [conserved nucleotides are in bold]) has 78% similarity with the reported E. coli consensus sequence with the conserved nucleotides mainly located at the 5' extremity of the sequence whereas the orp1 IHF2 site (CATCACAAGCTCG) shares less similarity (67%) but better distributed throughout the sequence (Figures S1 and S3).
The orp2 potential IHF site (AATCAAACATCTT) has 78% similarity with the reported E. coli consensus sequence.
Regarding the relative position of these IHF binding sites compared to those of sigma54 and of DVU2106, the orp1 IHF1 (-42) and IHF2 (-79) sites are located upstream the sigma54-binding sequence (position -13) and downstream the EBP binding site (position -131) (Figure S1).
The orp2 IHF binding site (-43) is located upstream the sigma54-binding sequence (position -11) and downstream the EBP binding site (position -88) (Figure S1).
Therefore, the locations of the three potential IHF binding sites are centred between sigma54- and DVU2106-binding sequences.

To determine the contribution of these IHF binding sites to the transcriptional activities of the orp1 and orp2 promoters, each of these consensus sites was altered by generating mutations at bases previously reported to be necessary for IHF binding [35] yielding orp1 IHF1-mut, orp1 IHF2-mut and orp2-IHF-mut and DVU2106-IHF-mut (DVU2106 promoter region in which orp2 IHF site was mutated) (Figure S2).
These mutations were introduced into plasmids carrying promoters-lacZ transcription fusions.
As done previously, expression of the wild-type and mutated promoter-lacZ fusions were compared in the IHF-proficient (wild-type) and IHF-deficient (DeltaihfA) strains that produced the transcriptional regulator DVU2106 from a compatible multicopy plasmid.
The accumulation of beta-galactosidase was measured and reported in Figure 4.
The expression of orp1 was not significantly affected by the mutation within the IHF1 site, as 98% of the beta-galactosidase activity was retained compared to the IHF proficient strain with native orp1'::lacZ fusion (Figure 4A).
By contrast, the beta-galactosidase activity decreased to 8% of the activity of the wild-type promoter when the IHF2 site was altered (Figure 4B), a value similar to that of the wild-type reporter fusion in an IHF-deficient strain (compare Fig. 4B and Fig. 1B).
When both sites were altered, the residual activity of the orp1 promoter was comparable to that observed with the single IHF2 site mutation (Figure 4C).
Regarding the expression from the orp2 promoter, mutation of the potential IHF site led to a 10-fold decreased beta-galactosidase activity compared to the wild-type reporter fusion (Figure 4E).
Here again, this activity is comparable to that of the wild-type fusion in IHF-deficient cells (compare Fig. 4E and Fig. 1D).
The expression of DVU2106, controlled by sigma70-RNA polymerase, was not influenced by the absence of IHF protein and by the disruption of the orp2 IHF site (Figure 4D).
These results demonstrate the requirement of the orp1 IHF2 and orp2 IHF sites for the efficient transcription of the sigma54-dependent orp1 and orp2 promoters, respectively.
These results further suggest that theses sites could be targets for IHF binding.

To address whether IHF binds to these putative IHF binding sites, we carried out EMSA experiments with increasing concentrations of the purified E. coli IHF protein and 32P-labeled orp1 and orp2 mutated promoters.
In agreement with the beta-galactosidase activities, figure 5 shows that disruption of the orp1 IHF1 site did not prevent formation of the IHF-DNA complex (Figure 5A) whereas mutation within the IHF2 site (or within both IHF1 and IHF2 sites) abolished IHF binding (Figure 5B and 5C).
Similarly, alteration of the orp2 IHF site significantly prevented IHF binding to the orp2 intergenic region (Figure 5D).
It should be noted that 8 nM of IHF are needed for observing the formation of the IHF/orp1 IHF2 complex when the orp1 IHF1 site is altered (Figure 5A) whereas only 4 nM of IHF are necessary to form the same complex when orp1 IHF1 is not altered (Figure 2A) suggesting that orp1 IHF1 might promote binding of IHF on the IHF2 site.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that the orp1 IHF2 site is required for IHF binding and orp1 transcription and the orp2 IHF site recruits IHF to activate orp2 transcription.
It is noteworthy that the purified IHF protein binds to sites centred between DVU2106 binding sites and sigma54 promoters in both operons, a result compatible with IHF function in DNA bending to facilitate contacts between the distantly-located EBP and sigma54-RNA polymerase.



The DvH DVU0396-DVU1864 Heterodimer is Functionally Active to Stimulate the Transcription of the orp Operons

IHF is usually described as a heterodimeric protein complex composed of the IHFalpha and IHFbeta subunits encoded by the ihfA (himA) and ihfB (himB) genes.
Genome analyses of various species known to encode active heterodimeric IHF revealed the presence of a single copy of genes encoding IHFalpha and IHFbeta, found at distinct locations on the chromosome and subject to independent regulatory influences [36].
Surprisingly, two orthologs of himB, DVU1864 and DVU2973 that would encode IHFbeta, are annotated on the DvH genome.
Amino acid sequences of DVU1864 (called here beta1) and DVU2973 (called here beta2) are 65% identical together and respectively 42% and 45% identical to the E. coli IHFbeta (Figure 6).
By contrast, no gene encoding IHFalpha was annotated whereas six orthologs of hup genes encoding HU proteins were detected.
Nevertheless, it has been previously proposed that two of the putative HU-encoding genes, DVU0396 and DVUA0004, correspond to himA that encodes the IHFalpha protein [25].
Primary sequence comparison of DVU0396 and DVUA0004 with IHFalpha from E. coli revealed only 31% and 21% identity, respectively (Figure 6).
More recently, results obtained from pull-down experiments using DVU1864 as bait identified DVU0396 as the preferential prey [37].
It should also be noted that DVUA0004 is located on the endogenous plasmid of DvH, which is lost in our growth conditions.

In order to identify the active IHF from DvH, orp1 and orp2 promoter-lacZ transcription fusions were introduced into the IHFalpha-deficient E. coli (DeltaihfA) strain that produces the transcriptional regulator DVU2106 and the HU protein DVU0396 or both DVU0396 and DVU1864 from a compatible multicopy plasmid (Figure 7).
Surprisingly, the construction producing DVU0396 was easily obtained in wild-type E. coli whereas the plasmid producing DVU0396 and DVU1864 was obtained after reducing the production of these two genes suggesting a toxic effect of the simultaneous production of both proteins.
By contrast, no growth effect was observed when DVU0396 and DVU1864 are produced in the IHF-deficient E. coli strain (data not shown).
Figure 7 shows that the beta-galactosidase activities of the orp1 and orp2 reporter fusions were very low in the DeltaihfA strain, independently of the presence of the DVU0396 protein.
However, the concomitant production of DVU0396 and DVU1864 in the DeltaihfA strain restored the activities of the orp1 and orp2 promoters to levels comparable to that observed in the wild-type strain.
These results show that DVU0396 and DVU1864 are both required to activate orp1 and orp2 expression in vivo and further suggest that these two proteins may interact to assemble a functional heterodimer.



Functional Analysis of the DvH DVU0396 ihfalpha Mutant

As shown above, the DVU0396 and DVU1864 proteins may interact to stimulate the transcription of the orp operons in the in vivo reconstitution approach using the heterologous host E. coli.
The amino-acid sequences of the two putative IHFbeta proteins encoded by DVU1864 and DVU2973 being 65% identical, one may suggest that both proteins may have redundant function.
From these observations, and in order to determine whether IHF is physiologically required for the activation of the divergent orp operons in DvH, we deleted the DVU0396 gene on the DvH chromosome.
Under anaerobic conditions and in lactate/sulfate medium, the deletion of DVU0396 did not induce significant effects on DvH growth (final biomass and growth rate).
The transcription levels of orp1, orp2 and DVU2106 were compared by qRT-PCR in the wild-type and the DVU0396 mutant strains in both exponential and stationary phases.
The expression ratio of orp1, orp2, and DVU2106 [log2(absolute gene regulation)===-0.406, -0.404 and -0.805, respectively, using the wild-type strain as reference] showed that the absence of DVU0396 protein has no effect on orp1 and orp2 expression in DvH.
Our further qRT-PCR analyses showed that the absence of DVU0396 is not compensated by an increasing expression of the genes encoding the IHFbeta1 (DVU1864) or IHFbeta2 (DVU2973) subunit [log2(absolute gene regulation)===0.797 and 0.308 respectively, using the wild-type strain as reference].
Taken together these results indicate that the absence of DVU0396 is not compensated by the upregulation of genes encoding IHFbeta subunits and does not affect the expression of the orp operons in DvH.
