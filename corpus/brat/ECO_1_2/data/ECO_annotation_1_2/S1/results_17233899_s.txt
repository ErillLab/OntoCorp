Effects of Lrp and IHF on RNAP binding to the gltBDF promoter region

We have previously shown that Lrp and IHF bind simultaneously to gltBDF promoter (PgltB) DNA, yielding a band with intermediate gel shift mobility between the IHF-DNA and Lrp-DNA complexes (Fig. 3C in [14]).
Fig. 3A shows that the Lrp-binding region yields a subtly altered Lrp-dependent DNAse I footprint in the presence of IHF, though the IHF footprint is not obviously changed by the presence of Lrp.

RNA polymerase holoenzyme (RNAP) binds to PgltB in the absence of other proteins, as revealed by electrophoretic mobility shift of a DNA segment from -406 to +131 (relative to the transcription start; not shown).
However DNAse I footprinting analysis of this binary complex revealed no obvious regions of protection (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 5 and 6).
Since the absence of either Lrp or IHF leads to a >30-fold reduction in gltBDF transcription [5,14], we investigated whether these two proteins influence RNAP binding to PgltB.
Mobility shift experiments were not informative as, under our conditions, the large shift due to RNAP alone was indistinguishable from shifts due to RNAP together with Lrp and/or IHF.
However DNAse I protection analysis revealed that the combination of Lrp, IHF and RNAP results in a footprint in the promoter region, with strongly enhanced cleavage at the -19 position of the template strand and protection in the remainder of the region between the -10 and -35 hexamers (Fig. 3B, compare lane 7 to lanes 5 and 6).
This protection extended ~30 bp upstream of the -35 hexamer, merging with the footprint of IHF, and some protection was visible even farther upstream between the IHF and Lrp binding sites.
A combination of just Lrp and IHF does not result in any additional footprint aside from those of the individual proteins [14], and in particular the extended protection upstream of the -35 hexamer is not seen in the absence of RNAP (Fig. 3A).



Crp-cAMP regulation of gltBDF transcription

We searched for proteins from an E. coli whole-cell extract that bound to immobilized, biotinylated PgltB DNA, using Ciphergen ProteinChips (TM) and mass spectrometry.
This method had previously implicated IHF as a factor involved in gltBDF regulation, as we subsequently confirmed [14], but additional mass peaks representing other DNA binding proteins had not yet been investigated.
The analysis suggested ArgR (regulator for the arginine regulon) and Crp (catabolite repressor protein) as potential additional regulators of gltBDF (Fig. 4).
Several decades ago Prusiner et al. reported negative regulation of glutamate synthase expression by Crp [15].
Specifically, glutamate synthase activity is doubled in a mutant lacking adenylate cyclase (cya), and reduced 1.5-fold by addition of exogenous cAMP or growth with glycerol as the carbon source (which increases cAMP levels) [15].
However, it was not determined whether these results involved direct interactions between Crp and PgltB.

Our inspection of the gltBDF DNA sequence revealed a potential Crp-binding site between -76 and -55 (Fig. 5A, top two lines).
We have not attempted to measure transcription of a gltB-lacZ fusion in isogenic crp and crp+ strains, to complement the earlier data of Prusiner et al. [15].
This is because the crp mutant grows much more slowly than its isogenic partner [20], and comparisons would be complicated by the different growth rates [21].
However we have taken three complementary approaches to demonstrate a direct effect of Crp-cAMP on glt transcription.

First, we carried out mobility shift assays using purified Crp and a gltBDF DNA fragment containing the region from -406 to +246.
Crp bound the glt DNA with an apparent Kd of 35 nM in the presence of 20 muM cAMP (Fig. 5B).
Replacing the region between -121 and -48 with heterologous DNA [14] resulted in loss of detectable binding (Fig. 5C).
When cAMP was not added to the gel, but was present in the binding reaction, binding was still observed but the shifted bands were smeared, suggesting that the complexes were unstable under this condition (not shown).

Second, we carried out DNAse I footprint analyses, using purified Crp, cAMP, and PgltB DNA.
A defined region of partial protection was seen between -71 and -52 on the non-template strand (Fig. 5E), and -72 to -57 on the template strand (not shown).
Thus Crp-cAMP interacts directly with PgltB.
The Crp binding is centered at -65.5, in the predicted binding sequence (-76 to -55), and between the -35 hexamer and the IHF binding site (Fig. 2A).

Third, we determined the effects of the membrane-permeable derivative dibutyryl-cAMP on expression of gltB-lacZ with and without alteration of the Crp binding sequence.
The alterations are shown in Fig. 5A (bottom line), and replace all of the most highly-conserved nucleotides of known Crp-binding sequences (shaded) that were not already different in the native gltBDF promoter.
Concentrations of dibutyryl-cAMP as high as 50 muM had no effect on the growth rate of the cultures (not shown), and we used 10 muM in the experiments described here.
As a control, parental strain W3110 (with an intact lac operon) was grown in a defined glucose rich medium plus the inducer IPTG.
As shown in Fig. 6A, dibutyryl-cAMP had the expected effect of increasing lacZ expression in the parental strain, due to relief of catabolite repression [22].
In contrast, Fig. 6B shows that dibutyryl-cAMP reduced expression of lacZ fused to WT PgltB, while Fig. 6C shows that dibutyryl-cAMP had no effect on lacZ fused to PgltB having the altered Crp binding sequence.
Similar results were obtained in glucose minimal medium (not shown).

As Crp most often acts as a transcription activator, we explored some possible explanations for its repressive effect on PgltB.
One possibility, given the proximity of the Crp and IHF binding sites (Fig. 2A), and the requirement of IHF for activation by Lrp [14], is that Crp interferes with IHF binding.
However mobility shift analysis indicates that Crp and IHF bind independently of one another (Fig. 5D), though the ternary and binary complexes could not be resolved from one another well enough to completely rule out limited negative (or positive) cooperativity in their binding.

A second possibility, which we did not test, is that the Crp-induced bend in the DNA [23] opposes that generated by IHF, preventing proper activation.
A third possibility is that Crp interferes with RNAP binding.
As noted above, RNAP alone fails to yield a clear protection pattern on PgltB DNA.
Adding Crp-cAMP, far from interfering with RNAP binding, resulted in the appearance of a well-defined pattern of RNAP-dependent protection (Fig. 7).
This pattern is, however, distinct from that seen when the coactivators Lrp and IHF are added in place of Crp (Fig. 3B).
One particularly striking difference, as an example, is the DNase cleavage at position -19, that shows hypersensitivity in the presence of Lrp + IHF but not in the presence of Crp (compare lane 7 of Fig. 3B to lane 7 of Fig. 7).



ArgR-Arg regulation of gltBDF transcription

The Ciphergen ProteinChip (TM) analysis referred to above yielded another E. coli polypeptide bound to PgltB DNA, having a molecular mass close to that of the regulatory protein ArgR (Fig. 4A).
The involvement of ArgR in gltBDF regulation is reinforced by the following three observations.
First, adding 7.5 mM L-arginine to MOPS-glucose medium nearly halved LacZ activity, in the gltB-lacZ fusion strain LP1000 (and its isogenic rph+ strain LP2020; see below) (Table 1).
Second, deleting argR from strains LP1000 (LP1050) or LP2020 (LP2023) doubled LacZ activity.
Third, adding arginine to the growth medium did not affect LacZ levels in the DeltaargR strain LP1050.

We have evidence that ArgR mediates its regulatory effect on the gltBDF promoter via direct interaction.
There are two good matches to the consensus ArgR binding site sequence [24,25] upstream of the promoter-distal Lrp binding site (Figs. 2A and 8A).
When gltBDF DNA containing the putative ArgR sites upstream of -270 was deleted, arginine had no effect on gltB-lacZ expression (strain LP1270, Table 1).
We extended this observation by using purified ArgR in mobility shift and DNAse I footprint analyses.
ArgR bound to gltB DNA (-406 to +246) with a Kdapp of 1.8 +- 0.7 nM (Fig. 8B), and to a 3'-shortened fragment (-406 to -128) with essentially the same affinity (Kdapp of 1.7 +- 0.06 nM; not shown).
These data were fitted using the Hill equation as previously described [26-28], and both binding curves were characterized by a Hill coefficient of 2.0, indicating that multiple ArgR molecules are binding cooperatively.

The sequence to which ArgR binds was determined by DNase I protection using gltB DNA from -462 to +161.
ArgR protected a region upstream of the distal Lrp binding site (Figs. 2A and 8C), extending from -361 to -318 on the non-template strand.
This encompasses the two ArgR consensus-matching sites, and is consistent with the Hill coefficient of 2.0.
Similar results were obtained for the template strand (not shown; a longer fragment, extending from -575 to +131, gave lower resolution due to the position of the footprint on the fragment).

We considered two possibilities for the basis of gltBDF repression by ArgR.
First, given the proximity of the ArgR and Lrp binding sites (Fig. 2A), we tested whether ArgR interfered with Lrp binding.
Mobility shift assays with ArgR and Lrp were inconclusive in this respect, because adding the corepressor arginine to the gel prevented the Lrp-DNA complex from migrating far into the gel (not shown).
However DNAse I footprint analyses suggest that Lrp and ArgR bind independently of one another (Fig. 9A).

A second possible basis for repression of gltBDF by ArgR involves interference with the proposed Lrp-RNAP interaction.
ArgR does in fact alter the protection pattern generated by the combination of Lrp, IHF, and RNAP (Fig. 9B, asterisks).
In the absence of ArgR there is a limited region of RNAP-dependent hypersensitivity that overlaps the ArgR binding site; addition of ArgR and arginine alters this hypersensitivity pattern.



Effects of rph on gltBDF expression

We considered the possibility that our measurements of gltBDF expression were being affected by a defect in the E. coli W3110 background.
This commonly-used K-12 strain carries a frameshift mutation in rph, the structural gene for RNAsePH, that results in decreased pyrE (orotate phosphoribosyltransferase) expression and in turn leads to pyrimidine limitation during growth in minimal media [29].
Pyrimidine biosynthesis is regulated by feedback inhibition, so it seemed plausible that W3110 would sense increased demand for glutamate (to provide needed glutamine precursors), and would thus have elevated gltBDF expression.
Consistent with this possibility, adding 20 mug/ml of the pyrimidine uracil to strain LP1000 in minimal medium resulted in a 1.5 fold reduction of PgltB-lacZ activity (strain LP1000 is a W3110 derivative carrying a gltB-lacZ fusion in a Deltalac background).
We replaced the W3110 rph allele with the wild-type gene (see Methods), and the new strain was designated LP2002.
Correcting the rph mutation roughly halved transcription from PgltB in strain LP2020 (strain LP2002 bearing Deltalac and a gltB-lacZ fusion, see Table 2), in agreement with the uracil addition results.
Strain LP2002 may be generally useful for studies of E. coli physiology.
