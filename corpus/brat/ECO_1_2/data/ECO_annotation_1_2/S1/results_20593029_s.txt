NrdR and Fur negatively regulate nrd expression

In order to assess the transcriptional role of both NrdR and Fur, unmarked nrdR and fur null mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2 were obtained as described in Materials and Methods and then transduced into Salmonella strains containing either nrdAB-lacZ, nrdHIEF-lacZ or nrdDG-lacZ reporter fusions (for DeltanrdR mutation) or just nrdHIEF-lacZ (for Deltafur mutation).
For the nrdAB and nrdHIEF operons, expression of the reporter fusions was measured in aerobic conditions throughout the cell cycle.
nrdDG cultures grew more slowly in anaerobiosis and samples were only taken at lag and exponential phases.
The beta-galactosidase activity assays (Figure 1) showed an evident upregulation of nrdAB, nrdHIEF and nrdDG expression in the absence of NrdR when compared to the wild-type strains, indicating that NrdR acts as a repressor of all three ribonucleotide reductases in S. Typhimurium LT2.
nrdHIEF expression increased nearly 12-fold compared to the wild-type strain.
nrdAB and nrdDG, however, increased only 3 and 5-fold respectively.
Moreover, a growth phase-related differential expression was also observed, being maximal during exponential phase.

As seen in Figure 2, Fur also repressed nrdHIEF expression, increasing its transcription up to 5-fold compared to the wild-type strain.
nrdAB expression was also measured to rule out a global effect of the Fur knock-out on overall gene expression (Figure S1).

To further assess if NrdR and Fur were indeed responsible for this upregulation we performed complementation assays.
Both nrdR and fur were cloned into the pBAD33 expression vector under the control of the PBAD promoter and their expression was induced upon addition of 0.3% L-arabinose.
beta-galactosidase levels for nrdAB, nrdHIEF and nrdDG in the NrdR and Fur complemented strains were similar to those of the wild-type strains, thus supporting their role as transcriptional repressors (Figures 1 & 2, respectively).



Effect of hydroxyurea in nrd expression

Since the late 70s it is well-known that the addition of hydroxyurea (HU) induces the transcriptional expression of both class Ia and class Ib RNR, either in E. coli, S. Typhimurium or other microorganisms [16], [20], [21].

Hydroxyurea scavenges the tyrosyl radical present in the small subunit of class I enzymes, thus inhibiting its catalytic activity, but it is as yet unknown how such a dramatic downshift in enzymatic activity causes this upregulation in nrd transcription.

Being a global nrd regulator, we wondered if NrdR might be involved in such phenomenon and, therefore, we performed beta-galactosidase assays to analyze the transcriptional levels of nrdAB, nrdHIEF and nrdDG in the presence and absence of 10 mM HU in both a NrdR mutant and a wild-type strain.

Figure 3 shows that during aerobic growth the induction levels of nrdAB and nrdHIEF caused by the addition of hydroxyurea were similar to those caused by deletion of NrdR.
The addition of hydroxyurea to the NrdR mutant did not show any additive increase.
Similarly, the beta-galactosidase levels of nrdDG were very much alike in the NrdR mutant regardless of the presence of hydroxyurea.
Wild-type nrdDG expression with 10 mM HU showed only a minor increase in both aerobic and anaerobic growth.



NrdR and Fur recognition sequences

The presence of putative nrdR recognition sequences has been studied by phylogenetic profiling in numerous bacterial genomes [22] and it has been established that the NrdR recognition site consists of two tandem NrdR boxes separated by approximately 31 - 32 bp.
In S. Typhimurium such boxes can be found within the promoter region of all three nrd operons [22], but their actual involvement in nrd regulation has not been empirically elucidated.

In order to demonstrate the participation of these recognition sequences in NrdR binding and promoter repression, we performed beta-galactosidase assays with promoter sequence fusions in which one or both putative NrdR boxes had been significantly altered (single versus double mutants, see Figure 4A).

As shown in Figure 4B, modification of either NrdR1, NrdR2 or both, increased nrdAB transcription, although only the NrdR2 mutant achieved a transcriptional increase similar to that of the DeltanrdR strain.

Modification of the NrdR1 box in the nrdHIEF operon resulted in an increase in nrdHIEF expression similar to that of the DeltanrdR strain.
Mutation of the NrdR2 box, however, had no effect on the transcriptional levels of nrdHIEF and the double mutant showed transcriptional levels similar to those of the NrdR1 box and the NrdR mutant.

nrdDG transcription was greatly induced in both the NrdR1 and NrdR2 mutants, with NrdR2 reaching a similar increase to that of the DeltanrdR strain, and NrdR1 even surpassing it.
The transcriptional levels of the double mutant paralleled those of the NrdR1 mutant.

Vassinova et al[9] initially described a putative Fur box within the E. coli nrdHIEF promoter region but so far there is no experimental evidence regarding a Fur-mediated regulation of class Ib nrd genes.
Previous studies in our laboratory indicated an upregulation of nrdHIEF under iron depletion and we identified a putative Fur binding box 309 bp upstream from the transcription start site (Figure 4A).
To assess its role in the Fur-mediated regulation of nrdHIEF we modified the putative Fur box by site-specific mutagenesis (Figure 5A) and monitored the beta-galactosidase levels of the nrdHIEF-lacZ reporter fusion.

As shown in Figure 5B, the transcriptional levels of nrdHIEF containing a mutated Fur box were very similar to those obtained with a Deltafur strain, thus indicating a role for this sequence in nrdHIEF regulation.



Fur protein directly binds the nrdHIEF promoter region

To further assess the role of Fur in nrdHIEF expression we wanted to demonstrate its direct union to the nrdHIEF promoter region.
Therefore, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) with a 478 bp probe containing the nrdHIEF promoter region as well as with another probe containing the same region with a mutated Fur box.
As a positive control we used the Fur promoter region since Fur has already been reported to autoregulate its own expression in E. coli[23].

Figure 6 shows the presence of a retarded band when Fur was incubated together with the wild-type promoter, but no mobility shift could be observed when we used a labelled probe containing an altered Fur box (data not shown).
A second retarded band seems to appear as protein concentration increases, likely indicating the presence of an additional Fur recognition sequence.
Indeed, an additional putative Fur sequence has been identified further upstream from the nrdHIEF promoter and its involvement in class Ib transcriptional regulation is in progress.



Construction of nrd mutants

nrdHIEF expression levels are usually low and insufficient to maintain cell growth in an nrdAB mutant, however, its expression is induced under nutrient starvation, iron depletion and oxidative stress [16], [18], [19], all of which are encountered by Salmonella during the course of an infection.
This observation, together with the fact that nrdHIEF is also regulated by Fur, one of the main modulators of virulence [24] - [26], suggests that nrdHIEF may have a leading role in the pathogenesis of Salmonella.

We therefore proceeded to evaluate the essentiality of each RNR class during the infectious process, first constructing nrd mutants for each RNR class and then combining them to obtain double mutants (Materials and Methods).

Since NrdAB is essential for growth under aerobic conditions, we used two different strategies to construct a class Ia mutant.
One nrdAB mutant was achieved by inserting an extra copy of nrdHIEF elsewhere in the chromosome.
The second type of DeltanrdAB mutant was constructed during anaerobic growth, where nrdDG is used to provide dNTPs.

DeltanrdEF (IG138) and DeltanrdDG (IG139) mutants were constructed according to the Wanner and Datsenko method (see Materials and Methods).

We also constructed the double mutants DeltanrdHIEF/DeltanrdDG (IG140) and DeltanrdAB/DeltanrdDG.
The latter mutant is not viable, either in aerobiosis or anaerobiosis, unless supplied with an extra nrdHIEF copy, but we wanted to check if overexpression of the cognate class Ib enzyme would suffice to maintain growth.
Therefore, this double mutant was constructed on both DeltanrdR and Deltafur background strains.
We first constructed the DeltanrdAB/DeltanrdR (IG143) and DeltanrdAB/Deltafur (IG144) double mutants grown anaerobically and then transduced the DeltanrdDG mutation to originate the triple mutant strains IG145 and IG146, respectively (Table S1).
Surprisingly, all nrdAB mutants overexpressing nrdHIEF proved capable of growing in the presence of oxygen with only a class Ib enzyme, although they displayed much slower growth rates as well as a filamentous morphology (Figure S2).



Role of RNRs during macrophage infection

nrd single and double mutants were used in gentamicin protection assays to infect RAW264.7 mouse macrophage-like cell lines in order to obtain proliferation indexes for each mutant strain.

As shown in Figure 7A, neither nrdEF (PI===2.1) nor nrdDG (PI===3.99) seemed to be involved in dNTP synthesis during pathogenesis.
The nrdAB mutant bearing two copies of nrdHIEF, however, could not proliferate at 24 h post-infection (PI===0.105).

The RAW264.7 cell line is defective in the Nramp1 protein, which mediates resistance to numerous intracellular pathogens (such as Leishmania, Mycobacterium, and Salmonella[27] - [29] presumably due to its inability to transport iron from the phagosome to the cytosol [30].
Thus, RAW264.7 cells produce a Salmonella containing vacuole (SCV) the iron concentration of which might be high enough to inhibit nrdHIEF transcription via Fur.

Therefore, we repeated the same assays this time using a cell line transfected with this transporter (RAW264.7 Nramp1+/+) [31].

All mutants showed lower PI compared to those with the RAW264.7 cell line, but overall we obtained similar results.
Neither the nrdEF (PI===1.204), nor the nrdDG mutant (PI===1.585) had significant differences when compared to the wild-type strain (PI===1.239), and the nrdAB mutant (PI===0.143) behaved very much alike in both cell lines (Figure 7A).

Nevertheless, when the RAW264.7 cell line was treated with 65 microM of the iron chelator 2,2'-dipyridyl (DIP), the nrdAB mutant containing an additional nrdHIEF copy showed a significantly higher PI than that of the untreated assay or the RAW264.7 Nramp1+/+ cell line (Figure 7B).

The nrdAB mutant bearing a single nrdHIEF copy (IG137) was also analyzed in both RAW264.7 and RAW264.7 Nramp1+/+ but at shorter times: 4, 6 and 24 hours post-infection (p.i.).
As shown in Figure 7C, this mutant was able to maintain its viability up to 6 hours p.i., eventually dying (at 24 h p.i.)
regardless of the cell line used.

Our next step was to assess whether the double (IG143 and IG144) and triple (IG145 and IG146) mutants experienced the same phenomenon.
Figure 8 shows that during the early stages of infection these mutants were also able to maintain their viability growing at the expense of nrdHIEF overexpression, although there were no significant differences in their proliferation indexes and those of the nrdAB mutant.
The effect of single nrdR or fur mutants on growth rates and macrophage infection was also evaluated as an additional control (Figures S3 and S4).



Role of RNRs during infection of epithelial cells

In order to further investigate the involvement of each RNR class in the pathogenicity of Salmonella we analyzed invasion and proliferation inside epithelial cells.

Table 1 shows the invasion and proliferation indexes (%) of the different mutants inside a HeLa epithelial cell line.

Our results indicate that nrdAB was essential for invasion and proliferation of Salmonella inside HeLa epithelial cells, and given the assayed conditions neither nrdHIEF nor nrdDG seemed to have a relevant role in dNTP synthesis.
