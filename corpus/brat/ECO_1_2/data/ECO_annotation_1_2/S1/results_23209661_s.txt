The phlA-phlF intergenic region in P. fluorescens 2P24 contains a PsrA binding site

The importance of inverted repeat sequences for regulatory protein binding has been established for numerous regulators [48], [49].
Previous studies have revealed the presence of several palindromic sequences in the phlA-phlF intergenic region in 2,4-DAPG-producing P. fluorescens[17].
A sequence alignment of the phlA gene promoter region from strain 2P24 with other well-studied 2,4-DAPG producing Pseudomonas strains revealed a very well conserved palindromic sequence GAAACN5GTTTC (Fig. S1).
This element is a potential recognition sequence for PsrA (Pseudomonassigma regulator), which was previously identified as a positive regulator of rpoS expression in P. putida WCS358 and P. aeruginosa PAO1 [50], [51] and was involved in the regulation of type III secretion system and quorum sensing [52], [53].
Our ongoing genome sequence of strain 2P24 revealed that this strain codes for a 237 amino acid PsrA homolog (Fig. 1).
This protein is predicted to have a pI of 9.75 and a molecular mass of 26.2 kDa.
It contains a helix-turn-helix motif (residues 10 to 56) in its N-terminal portion, which is conserved in members of the TetR family regulatory proteins.
PsrA of strain 2P24 is highly similar to predicted PsrA proteins from other pseudomonads, including P. fluorescens Pf0-1 (accession number ABA75608; 96% identity), P. fluorescens Pf-5 (accession number AAY91237; 93% identity), P. chlororaphis PCL1391 (accession number AAM52309, 95% identity), P. putida F1 (accession number ABQ79722; 94% identity), P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (accession number AAO56983; 91% identity), and P. aeruginosa PAO1 (accession number AAG06394, 87% identity).

The presence of a putative PsrA-binding sequence in the phlA promoter region suggests potential interactions between PsrA and the phlA promoter sequence.
We tested this hypothesis by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using the purified His6-PsrA protein and DNA fragments of the promoter.
A mobility shift was observed when His6-PsrA was incubated with the phlA promoter (Fig. 2A).
Importantly, no shift was detected when mutations disrupting the putative binding site were introduced (Fig. 2A).
These results indicate that PsrA may regulate the expression of the phlA gene by directly interacting with phlA promoter.



PsrA negatively regulates 2,4-DAPG production at transcriptional level

In LB medium, the psrA mutant PM113 produced higher levels of an uncharacterized red pigment, which is a characteristic phenotype associated with the production of the antibiotic 2,4-DAPG (data not shown) [3], [17].
Further quantification by HPLC showed that the 2,4-DAPG levels in culture supernatant of the psrA mutant were about 5-fold higher than that of the wild type strain.
Such increase could be repressed by introducing the psrA gene into the mutant (Fig. 2B).
An earlier study has shown that inactivation of the phlF gene results in overproduction of 2,4-DAPG in P. fluorescens 2P24 [54].
Interestingly, overexpression of PsrA in the phlF mutant caused dramatic reduction in 2,4-DAPG production (Fig. 2B).
To test the influence of PsrA on the phlA transcription, p970Gm-phlAp [46] carrying a phlA-lacZ transcriptional fusion was transformed into the psrA mutant and its parental strain 2P24.
When the cultures were in the stationary phase, expression of phlA increased about 3-fold in the psrA mutant compared to that of strain 2P24 (Fig. 2C).
Disruption of the PsrA box led to expression of the fusion irresponsive to the regulatory protein (Fig. 2B).
The expression of the phlF-lacZ transcriptional fusion was measured in a psrA-deficient mutant and no difference was detected between the mutant and 2P24 (data not shown).
In addition, Western blot assay using a chromosomal vsv-phlA fusion showed that levels of PhlA protein increased in the psrA mutant compared to the wild type strain (Fig. 2D).
Together, these results indicate that PsrA controls 2,4-DAPG production by directly regulating the transcription of the 2,4-DAPG biosynthetic operon.



PhlF and PsrA expressed differently in P. fluorescens 2P24

PhlF is a specific transcriptional repressor that regulates the expression of the 2,4-DAPG biosynthetic operon by binding to the pho site located about 120-bp downstream of the PsrA recognization site in the phlA gene promoter region (Fig. S1).
To compare the expression of psrA and phlF, lacZ fusion of these two genes was introduced into strain 2P24.
The psrA gene expressed in a cell density-dependent manner and reached its maximum in the stationary phase, whereas the transcription of the phlF gene reached the highest level earlier in logarithmic phase (Fig. 3).
Differential expression of PhlF and PsrA during cell growth implied their distinctive effects on phlA transcription.
PhlF is likely a major repressor during the early growth phase.
In agreement with this notion, 2,4-DAPG normally begins to accumulate during the transition from logarithmic to stationary phase [17].

PsrA regulates the expression of itself in P. putida, P. aeruginosa, and P. syringae by directly binding to its own promoter [51].
In strain 2P24, two putative PsrA-binding sequences (GAAACGTATGTTTC and CAAACAAGTGTTTG) are present in the upstream region of the psrA gene (Fig. 1).
By EMSA, we found that PsrA directly binds its promoter region (Fig. S2A).
Consistently, the psrA-lacZ fusion expressed at a higher level in the psrA defective mutant (Fig. S2B).



PsrA positively regulates the translational regulator RsmA

In some Pseudomonas strains, biosynthesis of 2,4-DAPG is tightly regulated at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional level [25], [27].
Multiple factors of the Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway, including the GacS/GacA system, the small RNAs RsmX, RsmY, and RsmZ, and the translational repressors RsmA and RsmE are important components of regulatory circuit that controls the production of 2,4-DAPG at posttranscriptional level [25], [33].
In P. fluorescens 2P24, three small RNAs, RsmX, RsmY, and RsmZ, and two small RNA-binding proteins RsmA and RsmE are present in the draft genome sequence.
To determine whether PsrA influences expression of these genes, we measured the transcription of these genes in the psrA mutant.
Although no difference for rsmZ, rsmY, rsmX or rsmE was observed (Fig. 4A - D), the expression of rsmA was significantly lower in the mutant (Fig. 4E).
Consistent with this observation, the rsmA mutant produced significantly higher amounts of PhlA protein (Fig. 2D) and 2,4-DAPG (Fig. 4F) than the wild type strain 2P24.
This increase of 2,4-DAPG can be brought to the wild type level by expressing rsmA in the mutant (Fig. 4F), further validating the negative role of RsmA in 2,4-DAPG production.
Thus, PsrA positively regulates the transcription of the rsmA gene, which in turn negatively controls the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAPG.



The effect of PsrA on rsmA gene expression is mediated by the sigma factor RpoS

The absence of a PsrA binding site in the promoter region of rsmA suggests an indirect effect of PsrA on rsmA transcription (data not shown).
A previous study has shown that RpoS positively regulates rsmA gene in Pectobacterium carotovarum and its homolog CsrA in E. coli[55].
Further, RpoS is a negative regulator for 2,4-DAPG production in P. fluorescens CHA0 and Pf-5 [19], [21].
In P. fluorescens 2P24, the production of 2,4-DAPG in the rpoS mutant increased about 3-fold when compared with the wild type strain (Fig. 5A).
We therefore examined whether RpoS regulates phlA expression.
The phlA-lacZ transcriptional fusion in the rpoS mutant expressed at levels similar to those in the mutant (Fig. S4), suggesting that the negative effects of RpoS on 2,4-DAPG production occurs at post-transcriptional level.

The above observations suggest that in strain 2P24, PsrA regulates rpoS expression, which in turn controls rsmA expression.
Careful inspection of the promoter region of rpoS of strain 2P24 revealed the presence of a putative PsrA binding site between -427 and -416 relative to its transcription start site.
Incubation of His6-PsrA with a DNA fragment containing this region led to the formation of DNA-protein complex, and no shift was detected when mutations disrupting the putative binding site were introduced (Fig. 5D).
In the psrA mutant, expression of the rpoS-lacZ decreased about 4-fold (Fig. 5B), suggesting a positive role of PsrA in rpoS transcription.
In the rpoS mutant, the rsmA-lacZ transcriptional fusion expressed at a significantly lower level than in the wild type (Fig. 5C).
The defect was caused by the loss of RpoS because introduction of a plasmid-borne allele of this gene completely restored the expression of rsmA (Fig. 5C).
To examine the protein level of RsmA, we created a chromosomal vsv-rsmA in the DeltarpoS strain background and found that similar to the results from the lacZ fusion, VSV-RsmA was produced at a lower level in the mutant (Fig. 5E).
The effect of RpoS on rsmA was specific because the expression of rsmE or the production of RsmE was not affected by rpoS deletion (data not shown).
Taken together, these results establish that in addition to directly affecting phlA transcription, PsrA influences the production of 2,4-DAPG posttranscriptionaly via RpoS and RsmA.



The effect of PsrA on 2,4-DAPG production is independent of the GacS/GacA system

In Pseudomonas spp., components of the Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway includes the GacS/GacA two-component system, the noncoding small RNAs and the translational repressors.
Among these, the GacS/GacA system functions as a global regulatory system which positively regulates transcription of the noncoding small RNAs by binding to a conserved UAS in the promoter region [29], [31].
In P. chlororaphis, the transcription of psrA was abolished in the gacS mutant, suggesting that the psrA gene in this bacterium was under the regulation of the two-component system [56].
To determine whether psrA was regulated by the GacS/GacA system, we measured the expression of the psrA-lacZ fusion in a GacS/GacA-deficient mutant and no difference was detected between the mutant and the wild type strain.
Similar results were obtained when the protein levels of PsrA were probed (Fig. 6).
Thus, the GacS/GacA two-component system has no effect on the expression of the psrA gene in this bacterium.
