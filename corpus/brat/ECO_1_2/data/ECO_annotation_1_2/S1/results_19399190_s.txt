apo-Fur Regulation in H. pylori

In order to study apo-Fur dependent regulation in H. pylori, the sodB and pfr promoters from strain G27 were fused to the promoterless gpfmut3 gene in pTM117.
Currently, these promoters represent the only known targets of apo-Fur [1], [8].
Given this apo-regulation and since promoter activity can be measured by changes in fluorescence with our system, we expected to see a decrease in GFP fluorescence under iron limited conditions for both promoter fusions.
However, as shown in Fig. 1A, the addition of iron chelator resulted in no change in the level of sodB expression.
This is in contrast to pfr, where iron depletion resulted in strong repression of pfr expression (Fig. 1B).
Both sodB and pfr were upregulated in a fur mutant (Fig. 1A and 1B) suggesting that both genes are repressed by Fur.
However, the lack of responsiveness to iron chelation suggested that sodB apo-regulation is not as expected in G27.

Since apo-Fur has been shown to have a lower affinity for the sodB promoter than the pfr promoter, and since the gfpmut3 allele encodes a long-lived GFP variant [23], we reasoned that we might not be able to detect small changes in GFP expression under the control of the sodB promoter under iron limited conditions.
Therefore, we performed RPAs to further investigate the discrepancy between our results and results previously reported for sodB regulation in strain 26695 [1].
Additionally, we considered the fact that strain specific differences might be responsible for the discrepancy.
Therefore, RPAs using a sodB riboprobe were performed on RNA isolated from WT and Deltafur derivatives from both G27 and 26695.
pfr and amiE (aliphatic amidase) riboprobes were also used as control apo-Fur and iron-bound Fur regulated target genes, respectively.
Fig. 2A shows results for all three riboprobes using RNA isolated from exponential phase cultures.
Again, we observed that for G27 the level of sodB expression did not change under iron-limited growth conditions (G) or under a harsher iron-depletion shock condition (S) that was added to ensure robust chelation as compared to normal (N) iron replete conditions.

Examination of sodB expression in 26695 revealed a smaller protected fragment than originally expected.
However, sequence analysis revealed that the smaller fragment is due to a small region of mismatch between the sodB mRNA sequence in 26695 and the G27 template DNA used to generate the riboprobe.
This mismatch causes a bubble of single stranded RNA to form and thus is subjected to RNase cleavage in the region of mismatch (data not shown).
For WT 26695, a 2-fold decrease in sodB expression was achieved under both iron-limited growth and iron-depletion shock conditions, which agrees with the previous report [1].
This change is Fur-dependent as there is no change in sodB expression under either iron depletion condition in the absence of fur.

Since it has been shown that growth phase strongly affects gene expression in H. pylori[21], we performed similar experiments on RNA harvested from stationary phase cultures.
As shown in Fig. 2B, we obtained identical results with the exception that the fold decrease seen in sodB expression was less pronounced in 26695 in this growth phase.
Again, there was no decrease in sodB expression in G27, indicating that growth phase is not responsible for the differences in our results.
Moreover, the difference in sodB regulation between the two strains is not the result of a generalized difference in apo-Fur regulation between G27 and 26695 since the appropriate decrease in pfr expression [8] was observed in both strains under iron-limited growth and iron-depletion shock conditions (Fig 2A and 2B).
Furthermore, iron-bound Fur regulation of amiE was as expected [24] for both G27 and 26695; amiE expression was increased under both iron limited conditions (Fig. 2A and 2B).
Taken in total, these data indicate that apo-Fur regulation of sodB is altered in G27 as compared to 26695.



Analysis of the role an amino acid (AA) difference in Fur plays in sodB regulation

Given the difference in sodB regulation between the two strains, we reasoned that either a difference in Fur or a difference in sodB between the two strains was likely to be responsible for the change.
We therefore aligned the predicted Fur amino acid sequence from G27 and 26695 to determine if there were any obvious differences between the two strains that might account for the differences in sodB regulation.
As shown in Fig. 3A, the last AA was found to differ between the strains.
In G27 AA 150 is a Tyr while in 26695 it is a Cys.
To determine if this AA difference had any role in Fur-dependent regulation of sodB, a "Fur swap" strain was created, which completely replaced the G27 fur coding sequence with the coding sequence from 26695.
RPAs were then conducted on RNA harvested from WT G27, WT 26695, and the "Fur swap" strain.
Results are shown in Fig. 4.
In order to show the reproducibility of the data, RPA data is represented in a graphical format.
In this manner the fold change for each strain and biological repeat is displayed as a point on the graph.
Additionally, the median fold change is depicted as a bar to allow for easy comparison between the strains.
Because the decrease in sodB expression in 26695 is most pronounced in exponential phase, only results of RPAs performed using exponential phase RNA are shown.
Expressing 26695 Fur in G27 (the "Fur swap" strain) did not restore apo-Fur sodB regulation in G27 under either iron-limited growth or iron-depletion shock conditions (Fig. 4A and data not shown).
However, apo-Fur regulation of pfr was as expected in all three strains (Fig. 4B and data not shown) [8].
Because the trends of the growth data for both the sodB and pfr RPA data were similar to the shock, the growth data has not been shown.

While the AA difference in Fur was apparently not responsible for the difference in sodB regulation, we wondered if the levels of fur expression were similar between the different strains.
To test this, RPAs were performed on RNA isolated from all three strains using a fur riboprobe.
The basal level of fur expression in each strain was then compared to that of WT 26695 as shown in Fig. 4C.
While the level of fur expression in the G27 strain was slightly higher than in 26695, no substantial differences in fur expression were found between the strains.

As Fur has been shown to be autoregulatory, repressing its own expression in the presence of iron [25], [26], we also compared Fur autoregulation between G27, 26695, and the "Fur swap" strain.
fur RPAs were performed on RNA isolated from each strain, and an increase in fur expression was seen for G27, 26695, and the "Fur swap" strain under iron-depletion shock conditions while little to no increase was seen under iron-limited growth conditions (Fig. 4D and data not shown).
This data shows that Fur autoregulation is consistent in each strain and further supports the notion that the AA difference in Fur is not responsible for the difference in sodB regulation between G27 and 26695.



RPA determination of the role the -5 bp of the sodB promoter plays in sodB regulation

Since the difference in sodB regulation between G27 and 26695 appeared not to be related to the difference in the Fur coding sequence, we next considered that there might be differences in the sodB promoter between the strains that could account for the discrepancy in regulation.
Therefore, we sequenced the sodB promoter from G27 and compared it to the known sodB promoter sequence from 26695 [14].
As shown in Fig. 3B, a single base change was evident in the Fur Box.
Previous DNA Footprint analysis showed that Fur protects a region that extends from -5 bp to -47 bp within the sodB promoter [1].
At the -5 bp, G27 encodes a C while 26695 encodes an A.
To determine if this nucleotide difference was important for sodB regulation, a "-5 bp swap" strain was engineered such that the G27 promoter would encode an A at the -5 bp position.
RPAs were then conducted on RNA isolated from the "-5 bp swap" strain along with WT G27 and WT 26695, and results are shown in Fig. 5.
While sodB expression remained unchanged in G27 under iron depletion shock conditions, a two-fold decrease in sodB expression was observed in the "-5 bp swap" strain (Fig. 5A).
The difference in fold decrease between G27 and the "-5 bp swap" was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.006, as was the difference between G27 and 26695 with a p-value of 0.0001.
While the fold decrease in sodB expression in the "-5 bp swap" strain under iron-limited growth conditions did not reach 2-fold, it was consistently higher than its G27 counterpart (data not shown).
apo-Fur regulation of pfr in each of these strains was similar and as expected [8] (Fig. 5B and data not shown).
These data suggest that a single nucleotide difference within the sodB promoter is at least partially responsible for the difference in regulation of this gene between G27 and 26695.



Comparison of sodB regulation in various strains of H. pylori

Given the differences in sodB regulation in G27 and 26695, we wondered if other H. pylori strains exhibited apo-Fur regulation similar to G27 or 26695.
Therefore, we also examined J99 and HPAG1.
Analysis of the sodB promoter sequences of these two additional strains showed that at the -5 bp HPAG1 encodes a C similar to G27, and J99 encodes a G that is different from all other strains (Fig. 3B).
Given that the A at the -5 bp seems to be crucial for apo-Fur regulation of sodB, we predicted that these strains would show Fur regulation of sodB similar to what was seen with G27.
To test this, RPAs were performed on RNA isolated from J99 and HPAG1.
As shown in Fig. 4, neither J99 nor HPAG1 displays the expected decrease in sodB expression [1]; both behave similarly to G27 (Fig. 4A).
However, pfr expression (Fig. 4B), basal levels of fur expression (Fig. 4C), and fur autoregulation (Fig. 4D) are preserved in J99 and HPAG1.
Taken together, these data suggest that natural polymorphisms found at the -5 bp of the sodB promoter in different H. pylori strains affect the regulation of sodB by apo-Fur.



In vitro binding of Fur to different sodB promoters

Given that the -5 bp in the sodB promoter appears to play some role in the apo-Fur regulation of sodB, we next investigated the direct interaction of apo-Fur with the various sodB promoters.
To assay the binding of apo-Fur, we performed Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs) and competition studies for each sodB promoter (WT G27, "-5 bp swap," and WT 26695) using purified Fur under apo reaction conditions [1].
As shown in Fig. 6, Fur binds to and retards the mobility of each of the three sodB promoters, but not the control rpoB promoter.
Moreover, the addition of homologous unlabeled sodB promoter DNA was able to compete for Fur binding with each sodB promoter thus confirming specific interaction between Fur and the sodB promoters (Fig. 6).

Because apo-Fur was able to bind to and shift each of the three sodB promoter fragments and because our expression data showed that the -5 bp was important for regulation, we reasoned that the various promoter fragments should show differences in their affinity for Fur.
To test this, each labeled sodB promoter fragment was competed with varying concentrations of its own (homologous) unlabeled promoter fragment as well as with each of the other unlabeled promoter fragments.
The success of the competition was then measured by quantitating the percent of unbound probe resulting from each competition reaction such that , where P===Fur, DP32===labeled DNA, and D===cold competitor.
As shown in Fig. 7, the various promoter fragments showed differences in affinity such that 26695 GTEQ -5 bp>G27.
In all cases, the 26695 and -5 bp promoter were better able to compete for Fur binding as the largest percentages of unbound labeled promoter fragment are observed with these two promoters in comparison to the WT G27 sodB promoter.
Taken together with the expression data, these data indicate that the -5 bp is important for Fur interaction at the sodB promoter.
