N2	Reference T2 brat_eco:ECO:0001118	protein sequencing assay evidence
#2	AnnotatorNotes T2	Annotated by Stephen. I chose BioProc here since the sentence can be interpreted as saying "Pao123 is a Lys-R-like transcriptional regulator, ",  or "Pao123 regulates transcription."
T3	ECO 6303 6341	at least in the growth conditions used

N3	Reference T3 brat_eco:ECO:0000095	cell growth regulation assay evidence
#3	AnnotatorNotes T3	Annotated by Stephen. This was a rough one for me to figure out. I feel like it's kind of a cheeky way of capturing the data, but it didn't feel right to not have a single annotation in this entire segment. I think it works though, since the sentence states that the cell growth assay revealed that these proteins are toxic.

N4	Reference T4 brat_eco:ECO:0000008	expression pattern evidence
#4	AnnotatorNotes T4	Annotated by Stephen. Is cytotoxicity GO? Would we have to annotate this as phenotype?
T5	ECO 8974 9022	LasR-dependent virulence phenotypes was compared

#5	AnnotatorNotes T5	Annotated by Stephen. Expression pattern evidence was really the best thing I could find for this. I couldn't find anything more descriptive in the ontology.
