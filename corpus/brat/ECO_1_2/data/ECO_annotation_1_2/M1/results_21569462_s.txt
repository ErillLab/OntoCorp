Identification of Ohr and OhrR homologues in S. meliloti

Blast search of S. meliloti genome for homologues of X. campestris Ohr protein revealed two paralogues, SMa2389 and SMc00040, showing 52 and 57% identity respectively with Ohr of X. campestris.
They possess conserved active site cysteines of Ohr/OsmC proteins [19].
SMa2389 is annotated as OsmC.
SMc00040 has been shown to be induced by peroxide stress [11]; it is divergently located from a gene encoding a MarR family regulator that has 49 and 45% identity with the OhrR regulatory protein of X. campestris and B. subtilis respectively.
SMc01945 has been previously published as OhrR like repressor since it presents 40% identity with OhrR of X. campestris [11]; the adjacent gene cpo (SMc01944) has been shown to encode a secreted peroxidase.

Co-localisation on the genome of ohr and ohrR was found in all bacteria in which these genes were investigated [20,31,36], suggesting that SMc00040 and SMc00098 encodes respectively Ohr and OhrR proteins.



ohr mutant growth is inhibited by organic peroxides

In order to investigate the role of ohr (SMc00040) and ohrR (SMc00098) in oxidative stress defence, S. meliloti strains with an ohrR deletion or carrying an insertion in ohr were constructed.
The ability of these mutants to resist exposure to oxidants was evaluated; neither of the two had any growth defect when grown aerobically in complete medium LB or in minimal medium GAS.
Moreover they possessed the same plating efficiency as wild type strain.

The influence of organic peroxides on growth of wild type, ohr and ohrR strains was analysed by adding increasing amounts of t-butyl hydroperoxide (tBOOH) and cumene hydroperoxide (CuOOH) to LB medium and determining the maximal OD570 nm reached by the cultures.
A concentration of 2 mM tBOOH abolished the growth of ohr mutant while the growth yield of ohrR and parental strains was unaffected.
Similarly 0.5 mM of CuOOH abolished growth of ohr strain but did not affect growth yield of ohrR and parental strains.

Disk diffusion assays were used to determine if ohr and ohrR mutations affected resistance to ROS.
The ohr mutant was less resistant than its parental strain when challenged with organic peroxides as shown by the zones of growth inhibition: 4.1 +- 0.2 cm for CuOOH and 3.1 +- 0.1 cm for tBOOH versus to 2.3 +- 0.2 and 2.5 +- 0.3 cm for wild type strain.
In contrast, ohrR mutation did not affect the resistance of S. meliloti against tBOOH and CuOOH since inhibition zones were not significantly (p value LTEQ 0.01) different from those of wild type strain (Figure 1).
The ohr-ohrR mutant behaved identically to the ohr mutant (Figure 1).

In other experiments, ohr and ohrR mutants were complemented by the moderate copy number plasmid pBBR1-MCS2 bearing wild type alleles of ohr (pBBohr) or ohrR (pBBohrR).
The empty vector did not affect the resistance of wild type or mutants against tBOOH and CuOOH.
Plasmid vector carrying ohrR+ allele also did not affect the resistance to OHPs of these three strains.
In contrast the introduction of pBBohr in ohr mutant dramatically improved resistance to both tBOOH and CuOOH (Figure 1).
These results showed that Ohr is important in the defence against organic peroxides in S. meliloti.

In comparison with parental strain, ohr and ohrR mutants were not significantly affected in resistance to H2O2 and menadione; inhibition zones were nearly identical for the three strains.
No alteration of this resistance was observed after complementation of the mutations with pBBohr or pBBohrR.
This result agrees with the role of Ohr in other organisms and its specificity for organic peroxide resistance.



Regulation of ohr and ohrR genes

The transcriptional activity of ohr and ohrR genes was assayed in strain R7.16 carrying ohr::lacZ and ohrR::uidA transcriptional fusions in tandem with wild type copies of ohr and ohrR genes.

The expression of these fusions was analysed in LB medium and in the minimal medium GAS.
No difference was observed between both media.
The expression of ohr::lacZ and ohrR::uidA was followed throughout growth till the late stationary growth phase.
The expression of these two genes remained constant; no variation was observed after growth arrest.
Adding NaCl to the medium during exponential growth or during stationary growth phase did not affect ohr or ohrR expression (data not shown).
Such a result is expected for Ohr and clearly differentiates it from OsmC proteins that are induced by NaCl [15].

The influence of peroxides was analysed by introducing into the medium a concentration of peroxide that did not affect the development of exponentially growing cells.
Expression of ohr was induced 4-fold in the presence of 1.6 mM tBOOH, a 7-fold induction was observed with 0.25 mM CuOOH.
The addition of 10 mM H2O2 resulted in a 2-fold induction of ohr (Figure 2).

Induction of ohrR was also observed when cultures were exposed to tBOOH and CuOOH, induction ratios were lower than those observed for ohr gene.
In contrast H2O2 did not affect ohrR expression (Figure 2).



OhrR regulates ohr expression

A plasmid bearing ohr::lacZ transcriptional fusion (pE1541) was introduced into the ohrR mutant and the parental strain.
The expression of the fusion was analysed in LB medium in the absence of organic peroxides and 1 h after 0.25 mM CuOOH addition.
In the absence of peroxide, the expression of ohr::lacZ fusion was greater in the ohrR mutant than in the wild type strain (18.5 +- 1.3 and 9.6 +- 0.7 mumol of substrate hydrolysed min-1 mg of protein-1 respectively).
After CuOOH addition, the expression of ohr::lacZ was similar in ohrR mutant and parental strain (16.7 +- 1.4 and 17.5 +- 1.5 mumol of substrate hydrolysed min-1 mg of protein-1 respectively).
These results are in accordance with repression of ohr promoter by the OhrR regulator.



OhrR binds to ohr-ohrR intergenic region

The binding of OhrR to ohr-ohrR intergenic region was analysed by gel mobility shift assay.
In a first attempt, a 113 bp DNA fragment encompassing the entire ohr-ohrR intergenic region and ended at the initiation codons of ohr and ohrR, was used as a probe (Figure 3A).
Two retarded bands were observed in the presence of OhrR (Figure 3B).
The intergenic region between SMb20903 and SMb20964 (this latter gene encoding the putative AhpC protein of S. meliloti) was used as a negative control.
No specific binding of OhrR protein to this DNA fragment was observed (data not shown).

We took advantage of restriction sites located within the ohr-ohrR intergenic region to define further OhrR binding site.
ApoI cleaved once this fragment giving a 17 bp and a 96 bp fragment.
In the presence of OhrR protein the longer fragment produced two shifted bands (Figure 3).
Two HpaII sites are located within ohr-ohrR intergenic region; HpaII cleavage produced three fragments of 26, 29 and 58 bp.
In the presence of OhrR, the intensity of the 58 bp fragment decreased and two retarded bands were observed (Figure 3B).
Thus OhrR binding sites are located within the 58 bp HpaII fragment.
None of the DNA fragments generated by BssHII (54 and 59 bp) or MseI (47, 50 and 16 bp, the last not detected on the gel) were shifted in the presence of OhrR (Figure 3B).
The unique BssHII and both MseI sites are located within the 58 bp HpaII region, which suggests that OhrR binding site is located within the 16 bp MseI fragment or overlaps its extremities and overlaps the BssHII site.

Two imperfect palindroms (Figure 3A) are located within the 58 bp HpaII region.
Moreover MseI and BssHII sites overlap these motifs.
Motif 1 (GCAAATTAATTTTG) and motif 2 (GCAAATTGCTTTGC) look like the OhrR binding site GCAATT-AATTCG found in other bacteria [31,34,36,37].
Motif 1 and motif 2 are adjacent as observed for OhrR binding sites of B. subtilis [36], A. tumefaciens [31], S. coelicolor [34] and X. campestris [37].

To further analyse OhrR binding, 60 bp DNA fragments containing in their centre 17 nt corresponding either to motif 1 or motif 2 were synthesised.
The OhrR protein was found to bind to both fragments.
Mutations were introduced in motif 1 to confirm the importance of this sequence.
The modification of GC to AA or AAA to CCC in one half of the palindrome abolishes the binding of OhrR to the DNA fragments (Figure3C).



Modulation of OhrR activity by oxidation

S. meliloti OhrR protein contains two cysteine residues conserved at the same position than in OhrR of X. Campestris, allowing the possibility to form inter-subunit disulfide bonds upon oxidation.

Purified OhrR was treated with CuOOH, H2O2 or DTT and the products were analysed by non reducing SDS-PAGE (Figure 4A).
In the presence of DTT, S. meliloti OhrR protein migrated as a band of an apparent MW of 15 kDa (the calculated molecular mass being 17.5 kDa).
Incubation of the protein with CuOOH or H2O2 led to the formation of a band of 30 kDa corresponding to the dimeric form.
The formation of the dimer was reversed by an excess of DTT.
Thus, as observed in X. campestris [30], the oxidation of OhrR induces a reversible bonding between the two subunits of the protein (Figure 4A).

Binding of OhrR to ohr-ohrR intergenic region was suppressed when 10 mM H2O2 was added to the binding mixture.
Binding was recovered after addition of an excess of DTT.
Thus only the reduced form of OhrR was able to bind DNA (Figure 4B).



ohr strain forms fix+ nodules in alfalfa

The sensitivity of S. meliloti ohr mutants to OHPs is potentially relevant to symbiosis since legume root cells respond to rhizobial infection with an enhanced production of ROS [4,38].
To test the effect of ohr mutation on nodulation and nitrogen fixation, one week old seedlings of Medicago sativa were inoculated with either the S. meliloti ohr mutant or the parental strain.
Plants were grown in nitrogen-deprived medium.
Five weeks after the inoculation, plants were visually screened for nodulation by observing the root system.
A highly efficient nodulation was observed on plants inoculated with either ohr or parental strains.
No significant difference between dry weights of plant shoots was observed.
The inoculated plants had green leaves and comparable number of nodules, whereas the non-inoculated control plants were smaller, with yellow leaves and significantly lower dry weight.
Nodules from plants inoculated with the ohr mutant were crushed and the bacteria recovered by plating on MSY plates before assayed for gentamycine resistance and OHP sensitivity.
All the randomly selected colonies that were analysed were able to grow on gentamycine-containing plates and behaved like the original ohr mutant.
Thus N2-fixing nodules formed on alfalfa were due to infection by the ohr mutant and not by revertants.

In order to analyse ohr and ohrR expression in planta, beta-galactosidase and beta-glucuronidase activity were visualised by light microscopy on entire and sections of nodules from R7.16 (ohr-lacZ, ohrR-uidA, ohr+, ohrR+) infected plants (Figure 5).
No staining was observed in root hairs or infection threads.
Nodule staining co localises with pink coloration of leghemoglobin, corresponding to nitrogen fixation zone (data not shown).
Thus, in spite of the absence of a nodulation defect of ohr strain, both ohr and ohrR genes were expressed during nodulation.
This result is in accordance with the detection of Ohr protein in nodules in proteomic studies [39].
