Peroxide-sensing by single-chain OhrR repressor proteins (scOhrR)

To determine whether oxidation of one or two active sites (per dimer) is required for the functional inactivation of OhrR we generated a single chain OhrR (scOhrR) in which the two protein monomers were linked by a 5-amino-acid linker (Figure 1) or a 10-amino-acid linker (which yielded comparable results; data not shown).
Four different scOhrR variants were characterized.
One contained two wild-type OhrR domains (WT-WT), one contained a C15S substitution mutation in the amino-terminal domain (C15S-WT) and another in the carboxyl-terminal domain (WT-C15'S; where the prime indicates residues from the C-terminal, momomer domain), and one contained two mutations in the amino-terminal domain (C15S,G120C-WT) to allow formation of a disulfide bond upon oxidation as previously reported (15).
The single-chain repressors were expressed under the control of their native promoter and regulatory elements from a plasmid integrated in single copy into the thrC locus.


To monitor the activity of the scOhrR proteins, we used an integrated ohrA-lacZ reporter fusion as described (3,16).
All four scOhrR repressors were fully functional as repressors as judged by complementation of the ohrR mutant strain (Figure 2).
The WT-WT scOhrR responded normally to organic peroxides in vivo as compared to the monomeric OhrR (expressed from the integrational plasmid pDG1731-OhrR).
In contrast, those scOhrR variants that retained only a single active site cysteine were significantly reduced in their ability to respond to CHP.
This relatively poor responsiveness was observed regardless of which monomer domain contained the active site C15 residue (Figure 2A) and was observed with both the 5 and 10 amino-acid linkers (data not shown).
The scOhrR with the active site within the C-terminal domain responded better to oxidant under all conditions tested.
When cells were treated with LHP, a similar pattern of responsiveness was observed, and in this case the C15S-WT scOhrR variant allowed approximately 50% derepression relative to the WT-WT scOhrR and monomeric WT OhrR controls (Figure 2B).
This pattern of responsiveness was further confirmed by using northern blot analyses to directly monitor expression of the ohrA mRNA (Figure 2C).


It is not obvious how to interpret these partially responsive phenotypes.
The fact that significant responsiveness is still observed with scOhrR repressors containing a single active site suggests that oxidation at one site is sufficient for sensing and responding to peroxides.
On the other hand, the reduced responsiveness (particularly for the WT-C15S scOhrR) suggests that full derepression may normally require oxidation at two active sites (at least for the scOhrR protein).



Functional inactivation of scOhrR in response to a single S-cysteinylation event

To more closely monitor the correlation between protein oxidation and DNA-binding, we purified each of the scOhrR repressors (Supplementary Figure S1) and monitored DNA-binding using a FA-based assay (Figure 3A).
As reported previously for the wild-type dimeric protein, the WT-WT scOhrR was completely inactivated by treatment with 6 muM CHP in buffer containing 10 muM free cysteine (13).
As expected, protein inactivation was due to S-cysteinylation since activity was rapidly and quantitatively restored by addition of dithiothreitol (DTT).


Next, we monitored the oxidation state of the scOhrR proteins by ESI - MS at 10 and 30 min after addition of CHP.
After 10 min, a time when DNA-binding activity was quantitatively lost, the majority of the WT-WT scOhrR was present as the singly S-cysteinylated protein (Figure 3B).
By 30 min an increased amount of the doubly modified protein was detected, although the second S-cysteinylation modification occurred at a much slower rate than the first.
A similar rate of S-cysteinylation was observed for the WT-C15'S variant which was also quantitatively inactivated under these conditions (Figure 3D).

When oxidation on the C15S-WT scOhrR was monitored the rate of functional inactivation was greatly reduced with only ~70% loss of DNA-binding activity after 30 min. of treatment.
As expected, ESI - MS analysis of this protein indicated only a single S-cysteinylation event and the amount of S-cysteinylated protein was correlated with the loss of DNA-binding activity (Figure 3C).

Together, these results indicate that oxidation of a single active site to yield the S-cysteinylated species is sufficient for loss of high affinity DNA-binding.
Dimeric OhrR normally binds to the ohrA operator site with a Kd ~5 nM under these conditions (13).
Since these FA analyses are conducted with 300 nM scOhrR, this suggests that oxidation leads to at least a 100-fold reduction in DNA-binding affinity.
Furthermore, oxidation of the WT-WT scOhrR was biphasic with oxidation of one C15 complete within 10 min. followed by much slower oxidation of the second active site cysteine (protein was not fully oxidized even after 30 min; Figure 3C).
These results indicate that the two active sites are no longer functionally equivalent in scOhrR, presumably due to restraints imposed by the linker.
Oxidation of C15 (in the amino-terminal domain of the scOhrR) is rapid (comparable to wild-type protein; Figure 3B versus 3D), whereas oxidation of C15' is significantly slower (Figure 3C).
The slow rate of oxidation at C15' may result from the fact that this Cys residue is closer both in primary sequence and in space to the linker (Figure 1B).



Oxidation of scOhrR by CHP in the presence and absence of free cysteine

We have previously shown that oxidation of OhrR in the presence of free cysteine leads to S-cysteinylation (as in Figure 3), whereas in the absence of cysteine the initially formed protein sulfenate slowly condenses with a backbone amide to generate an inactive protein sulfenamide (13).
Like the S-cysteinylated protein, the OhrR sulfenamide was reactivated by incubation with 10 mM DTT, but at a greatly reduced rate as judged using the FA DNA-binding assay.

We next compared the extent and rate of inactivation of all four purified scOhrR variants by CHP in the presence and absence of 10 muM free cysteine.
In the presence of cysteine, the WT-WT and the WT-C15S proteins were rapidly and reversibly inactivated by CHP (as in Figure 3A) while the C15S-WT scOhrR reacted slowly as noted above (Figure 4A).
The C15S,G120C-WT scOhrR also reacted slowly although in this case the additional cysteine residue can capture the initially formed cysteine - sulfenate to generate a protein disulfide.


When the scOhrR proteins were inactivated by CHP in buffer lacking free cysteine, the initially formed sulfenate is expected to slowly react to form the inactive protein sulfenamide (13).
Both the WT-WT and WT-C15S scOhrR proteins formed sulfenamides as judged by the characteristic (slow) rate of reactivation upon exposure to 10 mM DTT (Figure 4B).
The C15S-WT protein also formed an inactive sulfenamide as judged by the rate of reactivation, but protein inactivation was slower than for the WT-WT and WT-C15'S scOhrR proteins.
Again, this is consistent with the notion that in this case initial protein oxidation (at the more slowly reacting C15' residue) is rate-limiting and is slower than the rate of cyclization to the inactive sulfenamide.
As expected based on studies of the analogous dimeric protein (15), the C15S, G120C-WT protein was functionally inactivated by formation of a protein-disulfide since it is rapidly and quantitatively reactivated by 10 mM DTT even in the absence of free cysteine (Figure 4B).
Interestingly, the rate of inactivation of the C15S,G120C-WT protein was faster than that observed for the C15S-WT scOhrR.
This might reflect a change in the rate of oxidation of the slowly reacting C15' residue or, alternatively, a change in reaction pathway.
In this scOhrR, for example, CHP could initially oxidize the C120 residue to the sulfenate which could then form a disulfide by reaction with the C15' thiolate.
Regardless of the reaction pathway, these results indicate that formation of a single disulfide bond is sufficient to mediate protein dissociation.



Oxidation of scOhrR by LHP in the presence and absence of free cysteine

Unlike CHP, LHP reacts rapidly both with both C15 and the initially formed C15-sulfenate to generate overoxidized OhrR sulfinic (and sulfonic) acid derivatives (14).
The overoxidation of OhrR by LHP can be prevented, in part, by high concentrations of cysteine (which compete for the initial sulfenate product with LHP) or by addition of a second cysteine at position 120 to allow trapping of the sulfenate as a protein disulfide (14,15).

Exposure of either the WT-WT or the WT-C15'S scOhrR proteins to LHP in the presence of 1 mM cysteine led to rapid and quantitative inactivation of the protein (Figure 5A).
Under these conditions (1 mM cysteine) protein inactivation is due to S-cysteinylation at C15 as also noted with CHP treatment (Figure 4A).
However, the very high concentrations of cysteine needed to compete for the transiently formed C15-sulfenate also serves as a reductant of the S-cysteinylated protein, as shown previously for WT OhrR (13).
This can account for the slow regeneration of active protein prior to the addition of DTT.
Upon addition of 10 mM DTT, the protein is fully reactivated suggesting that there is little if any irreversible overoxidation under these conditions.
The C15S-WT and C15S, G120C-WT scOhrR proteins are only partially inactivated under these conditions.
This likely reflects the fact that oxidation at C15' is much slower than at C15 and the presence of high concentrations of free cysteine leads to protein re-reduction that now occurs on the same time scale as oxidation.


When these same reactions were repeated in the absence of added cysteine, both the WT-WT and WT-C15'S proteins were rapidly inactivated.
In this case, addition of 10 mM DTT was able to restore only a small fraction of the DNA-binding activity.
The poor recovery of DNA-binding activity with the WT-WT protein is consistent with irreversible protein overoxidation (14).
The inactivation of the WT-C15'S protein under these conditions suggests that overoxidation of a single active site is sufficient for protein inactivation.
The recovery of activity was slightly greater (~40%) with the WT-C15'S protein which suggests that in this case the rate of sulfenamide formation was comparable to the rate of protein overoxidation.
Under these same conditions, the C15S, G120C-WT protein was quantitatively inactivated and, in this case, activity could be fully and rapidly restored by 10 mM DTT (Figure 5B).
This indicates that formation of a single intraprotein disulfide bond is sufficient to trigger protein dissociation, consistent with the results with CHP (Figure 4B).
Finally, we note that the C15S-WT protein was inactivated very slowly under these conditions and the inactive protein appears to be largely in the form of the protein sulfenamide.
This is consistent with a model in which access to the active site C15' residue is impeded in the fused dimer leading to both a slow initial oxidation, and an ineffective second oxidation event, thereby allowing ample time for the cyclization of the initial sulfenate to the sulfenamide.
