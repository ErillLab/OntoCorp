Purification and Identification of DNA Binding Proteins

To collect DNA binding proteins, intracellular components with affinity to L. helveticus CM4 genomic DNA were co-precipitated with chromosomal DNA by adding polyethylene glycol 6000 as described in Materials and Methods.
The precipitated proteins released from DNA by adding 1 M NaCl were then applied to an affinity column in the presence of BCAAs.
The affinity column contained DNA-sepharose bound PCR fragments corresponding to the DNA upstream of the pepV, pepO, pepO2, pepT2, pepCE and dppD genes.
Proteins with molecular masses of 24, 26 and 67 kDa were specifically released from the affinity resin by washing with BCAA-free Hepes buffer (Figure 1A).
The three proteins were identified by sequence analyses of peptides released from each protein band.
The 67 kDa protein was identified as a prolyl-tRNA synthase, which would not be expected to bind to DNA.
In contrast, the 26 kDa and 24 kDa proteins were identified as same protein with homology to the 26.3 kDa protein lhv_0288 (YP_001576806.1) of L. helveticus DPC 4571 (NC_010080.1).
This result indicated that the 24 kDa protein might be a degradation product of the 26 kDa protein.
The 26 kDa protein has two tandem cystathionine beta-synthase domains (CBS pair) at the amino terminus as reported previously [26] (Figure 1B).
CBS catalyzes the formation of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine.
CBS domains with no catalytic domain [26] are widely distributed in most species of life but their functions are largely unknown.
A recent study suggested that the CBS domain protein MJ0729 from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii might bind to the E-box of DNA [27].
These results suggested that the 26 kDa protein with a CBS domain (CBS domain protein) might have affinity for DNA upstream of the pepV, pepO, pepO2, pepT2, pepCE and/or dppD genes in the presence of BCAAs.



DNA Binding of the CBS Domain Protein

To confirm the DNA binding ability of the 26 kDa CBS domain protein from strain CM4, the corresponding gene was amplified by PCR using primers 26 kF and 26 kR (Table 1) to prepare a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein by the method described in Materials and Methods.
The GST fusion protein was expressed in E. coli HB101, and the CBS domain protein was purified by using a glutathione-sepharose affinity column (Figure 1B).
Then, electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out with the purified protein and a 309 bp DNA fragment corresponding to the pepV promoter region in the presence or absence of 10 mM BCAAs.
The DNA band was shifted by 3 microM CBS domain protein in the absence or presence of BCAAs (Figure 2).
However, a band shift was observed with 1.5 microM CBS domain protein only when BCAAs were present (Figure 2).

To understand the effect of various single amino acids on the binding of the CBS domain protein to DNA, 10 mM each of Val, Leu, Ile, Gly, His, Ser, Thr, Pro or Met was used in EMSAs with the pepV upstream probe.
Each BCAA promoted CBS domain protein binding to the pepV gene, and Ile was most effective.
However, no shift was observed in EMSAs with the other tested amino acids (Gly, His, Ser, Thr, Pro or Met) (data not shown).
These results also suggest that Ile has the highest affinity for the ACT domain, and the BCARR-Ile complex is capable of binding to the target DNA.
Unlike Bacillus subtilis CodY, the transcriptional regulator that senses BCAAs in B. subtilis, GTP was not necessary for the CBS domain protein to bind to DNA (data not shown).



Transcriptional Regulation of the CBS Domain Protein (BCARR)

L. helveticus CM4 is a non-transformable strain and therefore we were unable to isolate a mutant strain lacking the gene encoding the CBS domain protein.
Therefore, to understand the influence of the CBS domain protein on the transcriptional level of the proteolysis system of L. helveticus CM4, the pepV gene was expressed in E. coli HB101 cells with or without co-expression of the gene encoding the CBS domain protein.
The pepV gene was expressed in E. coli HB101 by introduction of pBR-pepV, which includes the pepV ORF and about 500 bp of upstream DNA.
Then, the CBS domain protein gene was co-expressed with the pepV gene in E. coli HB101 harboring pBR-pepV-CBS (Figure 3A).
The transcription levels of the pepV gene in both strains, quantified by real-time PCR, were not changed in M9 minimal medium (Figure 3).
On the other hand, pepV gene transcription was decreased to 73% in E. coli harboring pBR-pepV-CBS compared to pBR-pepV, when casamino acids and BCAAs were present in the medium.
These results suggest the possibility that the CBS domain protein expressed in E. coli HB101 binds upstream of the pepV gene in response to BCAAs and represses transcription of the pepV gene.
The CBS domain protein may be a novel type of regulatory protein involved in controlling the transcription of the proteolytic system by sensing BCAAs in L. helveticus.
Therefore, the CBS domain protein was named Branched Chain Amino acids Responsive Transcriptional Regulator (BCARR), and the sequence was submitted to DDBJ (accession number: AB812553).



Consensus DNA Motif Search

To evaluate the binding of the BCARR protein to specific DNA fragments containing the promoters of the pepO, pepO2, pepT2, pepCE and dppD genes, which are negatively regulated in response to added peptides [11], EMSAs were carried out in the presence of BCAAs.
The results demonstrated that DNA fragments from upstream of the pepO, pepO2, pepT2, pepCE and dppD genes were shifted when the BCARR protein and BCAAs were present in the reaction mixture (Figure 4A).
A consensus DNA motif for binding of the BCARR protein was predicted in the regions upstream of the pepV, pepO, pepO2, pepT2, pepCE and dppD genes, by using MEME analysis [28].
An AT-rich sequence containing the palindromic DNA sequence 5'-AAAAANNCTWTTATT- 3', which was present upstream of each gene ranging from -255 to -14 from the start codon, was predicted to be the BCARR binding motif (BCARR-box) (Figure 4B).
Moreover, the consensus sequence motif was observed upstream of other genes involved in amino acid metabolism and transport, which were shown to be down-regulated in response to added peptides in a previous study [11], such as the hisM operon (position; -59/-45 from start codon), the potE gene (-181/-167), the lysA operon (-54/-40), and the serC operon (-21/-6).



Selected Binding of BCARR to the Region Upstream of the pepV Gene

To examine whether the BCARR protein preferably binds to the specific DNA sequence predicted as the BCARR-box (Figure 4B), EMSAs were carried out using various DNA fragments corresponding to the region upstream of the pepV gene as illustrated in Figure 5B.
As shown in Figure 5A, DNA fragments for DNA-266/-166, DNA-216/-116, DNA -136/+4 and DNA -76/+43 were slightly shifted when the BCARR protein was added in the presence of BCAAs (Figure 5A).
As expected, DNA -136/+4, which contains the predicted BCARR-box was highly shifted when 3 microM BCARR protein and 10 mM BCAA were added (Figure 5B).
The above observation reveals that a DNA fragment from -116 to -76 predicted by comparative sequence analysis, which contains the BCARR-box (-91 to -77), might bind with the highest affinity to BCARR in the presence of BCAAs as illustrated in Figure 5B.



Footprint Analysis of the pepV Gene with the Purified BCARR Protein

To examine whether the BCARR protein binds the predicted DNA sequence (BCARR-box) in the pepV promoter region, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed.
A 290 bp long DNA fragment carrying the promoter region of the pepV gene (-266 to +25), which was radioactively labeled at the 5' end of the forward strand, was used.
No protection was observed if no BCARR protein was added to the reaction mixture (Figure 6A).
However, the BCARR protein protected approximately 195 bp of the pepV promoter region when 18 microM BCARR protein was present in the reaction mixture (Figure 6A, lane 3).
These results demonstrate that the BCARR protein interacts with an approximately 195 bp long region of the pepV promoter, protecting the BCARR-box from -91 to -77 and the -35 and -10 promoter sequences as illustrated in Figure 6B.
These results also strongly suggest that the BCARR protein might affect the transcription of the pepV gene by binding and covering the promoter region (-35 and -10).



Prediction of the BCAA Sensing Domain Structure in the BCARR Protein

To understand the structural features of the BCARR protein, a possible domain motif for sensing amino acids at the C-terminal region of the BCARR protein was predicted (131 - 235 aa) by PSI-BLAST homology searching.
An ACT domain composed of four beta strands and two alpha helices arranged as a betaalphabetabetaalphabeta fold was observed at the C-terminus of BCARR (Figure 7).
ACT domains, named after the first letters of three of the proteins aspartate kinase-chorismate mutase-tyrA (prephenate dehydrogenase), have been reported to have the ability to bind amino acids and function to regulate certain aspects of amino acid metabolism.
Based on the alignment analysis, the glycine residue is most likely important in the binding pocket as it is well conserved in the ACT domain of BCARR (Figure 7).
These findings suggest that the 26 kDa BCARR protein might sense BCAAs at the C-terminal region and the association might increase its affinity for DNA when BCAAs are present.



Phylogenetic Analysis of L. helveticus CM4 BCARR Protein

Phylogenetic analysis of the L. helveticus CM4 BCARR protein revealed the presence of homologs in lactobacillaceae, enterococcaceae, leuconostocaceae, carnobacteriaceae, listeriaceae, exiguobacteria and bacillaceae (Figure 8).
