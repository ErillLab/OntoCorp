Analysis of the mle locus by RT-PCR and EMSA

In the genome of S. mutans UA159 [14], the lysR type transcriptional regulator MleR is orientated opposite to a gene cluster encoding the malolactic enzyme (mleS), a malate permease (mleP), and a oxalate decarboxylase (oxdC), respectively.
Additionally a putative prophage repressor is inserted between mleR and mleS (Figure 1).
This insertion is unique for the oral streptococci (S. mutans UA159, S. gordonii str.
Challis CH1 and S. sanguinis SK36) among all sequenced Lactobacillales.
Adjacent to the genes involved in malolactic fermentation is the gene oxdC encoding the oxalate decarboxylase which catalyses the conversion of oxalate to formate and CO2.
This gene is unique for S. mutans UA159 among all sequenced Lactobacillales.
RT-PCR disclosed that it is co-transcribed with mleS and mleP since it was possible to amplify overlapping fragments of all three genes (Figure 1A).
The putative gluthatione reductase (Smu.140) located downstream of oxdC, which is involved in the removal of reactive oxygen species, could not be assigned to the same operon by the use of RT-PCR.

Applying the Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) (Figure 1B) using a DNA fragment covering almost the complete intergenic sequence (IGS) between mleR and Smu.136c (EMSA 1) resulted in one retarded complex, indicating one binding site for MleR in this intergenic region.
Elongation of the DNA fragment (EMSA 2) to include the 3' end of Smu.136c, produced two retarded bands, suggesting an additional binding site at the 3' end of Smu.136c.
The presence of 5 mM L-malate in both EMSA reactions gave the same banding pattern.
However, the extent of the shift was slightly reduced.

Using the complete coding sequence of Smu.136c (EMSA 3) resulted in one retarded complex, confirming the presence of one binding site for MleR in this gene.
Addition of L-malate to the binding reaction changed the pattern in this case and produced two retarded fragments.
Truncation of the 3' end of Smu.136c (EMSA 4) resulted only in one retarded fragment, independent of L-malate.
The data show the presence of at least two binding sites for MleR within Smu.136c.
One site is located within fragment EP 6-7 (EMSA 4) presumably binding the apo form of MleR and another one is located at the 3'end of Smu.136c and appears to need the co-inducer bound form of MleR.
The intergenic sequence upstream of mleS (EMSA 5) produced one retarded complex in the absence and three complexes in the presence of 5 mM L-malate.
Thus, within this IGS also several binding sites for different forms of MleR exist.
Using internal DNA fragments of mleS or mleR (data for mleR not shown) or a sequence within the IGS of mleR and Smu.136c (primers 137qF/R) did not produce complexes with the MleR protein under the tested condition, thus confirming the specificity of the DNA-protein interaction.
Incubation of all used DNA fragments with BSA instead of MleR resulted in no retardation (data not shown).



Involvement of mleR in MLF activity

It was previously shown that S. mutans UA159 was able to carry out malolactic fermentation [17].
To determine if the putative regulator MleR is involved in the regulation of the MLF gene cluster a knockout mutant of mleR was constructed, by replacing an internal part (amino acids 27-275) of the gene with an erythromycin resistance cassette, amplified from another strain [18].
S. mutans wildtype cells showed highest MLF enzyme activity in the presence of 25 mM L-malate at the beginning of the stationary phase [17].
Under these conditions, we observed a significant reduction of MLF activity of the DeltamleR mutant compared to the parental strain, indicating a positive regulation of the mle genes by MleR (Table 1).
After one hour the wild type strain converted or internalised over 40% of the added L-malate.
For the mutant lacking the MleR regulator only a 1% reduction of the added malate within one hour was observed.
Furthermore, internalisation and decarboxylation of the stronger malic acid to lactic acid leads to a considerable increase of the external pH (Table 1).
However, after 12 hours of incubation a reduction of 78% and 38% of the added L-malate was observed in the wildtype and the DeltamleR mutant, respectively, indicating a basal level of MLF enzyme activity in the absence of MleR.



Transcription of mle genes during growth

To obtain better insights into the transcriptional regulation of the MLF gene cluster and mleR itself, firefly luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed.
The upstream sequences of mleR and mleS containing the putative promoter sequences were cloned in front of a promoterless luciferase gene and then integrated into the genome of the wildtype and the DeltamleR mutant by single homologous recombination, respectively.
Luciferase activity was monitored during growth in the absence of L-malic acid (Figure 2).
The highest activity for both promoters was observed at the transition to the stationary phase, with an external pH between 5.8 and 6.1.
This was true for the parental strain and the DeltamleR mutant, indicating that both transcriptional units might be controlled by acid inducible promoters.
To rule out that this up-regulation was not due to post-exponential phase phenomena, we investigated the influence of the pH during the exponential growth phase in more detail (see below).
However, in the wildtype the mleS promoter construct showed higher activity than in the DeltamleR knockout strain, indicating that MleR induces transcription even in the absence of the potential co-inducer L-malate.
Accordingly, quantitative real time RT-PCR of RNA isolated from cells in the late exponential phase in the absence of L-malate showed a 3-fold induction of the genes mleS and mleP when comparing the wildtype to the DeltamleR mutant strain.
An induction of mleR itself under these conditions was not observed (data not shown).



Regulation of the mle genes by pH and L-malate

During batch cultivation without addition of external L-malate, the highest luciferase activity for the mle promoters was observed during the transition to the stationary phase (see above).
Addition of L-malate as free acid to the culture (end concentration of 25 mM), thereby lowering the pH to 5.6-6.2 (depending on the growth stage in BM medium), resulted in an immediate induction of activity (Figure 3).
To determine if this effect was caused by the low pH or by L-malate, we further studied the influence of both parameters separately.
After inoculation, cells were allowed to adapt for two hours to the medium.
After addition of neutralized L-malate (25 mM final concentration) the pH of the cultures was adjusted with HCl to the desired values and samples for luciferase measurements were withdrawn in intervals of 30 min for two hours.
Figure 4 summarizes the fold change values of promoter activity after two hours of measurement.
Lowering the pH, without addition of malate, resulted in an increased activity of both promoters in the wildtype as well as in the DeltamleR background.
These data clearly demonstrate that both promoters are acid inducible and that this behaviour was not caused by post-exponential phenomena.
Furthermore, it shows that the influence of MleR is weak at neutral pH conditions.
By contrast, the presence of L-malate at low pH significantly enhanced the activity of both promoters, but only in the presence of a functional copy of mleR.
This allows four conclusions: (a) L-malate is the coinducer of MleR; (b) enhanced transcription in the presence of L-malate requires an acidic pH; (c) MleR positively regulates its target genes and furthermore (d) its own transcription.
A positive auto-regulation would be a special feature, since most LTTR repress their own transcription.
However, exceptions exist e.g. LrhA [19].
However, no significant induction of mleR after two hours exposure to 25 mM free malic acid was observed using quantitative real time PCR (See below).



Quantitative real time PCR

The transcript levels of the genes Smu.135-140 were determined using quantitative real time RT-PCR.
To this end, an early log phase culture of the wildtype was divided.
To one part free malic acid (25 mM final concentration) was added, the other part remained untreated.
RNA was sampled prior to splitting the culture and after two hours.
All tested genes, except mleR itself, showed enhanced transcription in the presence of malic acid compared to time zero (Figure 5).



Influence of L-malate and MleR on growth

Since L-malate does not serve as a catabolite facilitating growth of S. mutans we were interested to see how energy gain and pH maintenance due to MLF affect its ability to grow in an acidic environment.
To study this, we used BM medium supplemented with 1% (w/v) glucose (pH adjusted to 6.0) with or without supplementation of L-malate.
In the absence of L-malate, there was no difference in growth of the wildtype and the DeltamleR mutant strain.
Both strains entered the stationary phase after 6-7 hours at an external pH of about 4.2 and reached a final OD600 of about 0.41 (Figure 6A).
Inoculation of neutral BMG with this culture (pH 7.4) resulted in an optical density of ~ 1.0 for both strains, ensuring that the pH and not nutrient limitation were the determinant for entering the stationary phase at acidic conditions.
Addition of L-malate to the acidified culture medium facilitated pH maintenance and further growth of both cultures (Figure 6A).
The presence of L-malate resulted in a substantially higher optical density of the wild type compared to the mleR knockout strain.
Both strains were capable of carrying out MLF, as monitored by the L-malate concentration in the supernatant (Figure 6B), but the mutant to a much smaller degree than the wildtype.
Further on significant internalisation/decarboxylation of L-malate started when the external pH dropped below 5, confirming the luciferase reporter data which had shown that the malolactic fermentation system is only activated at low pH.



Influence of L-malate and mleR on the ability of S. mutans to tolerate acid stress

Since MLF has been shown to facilitate pH maintenance [17], we studied the contribution of MLF to acid tolerance in S. mutans (Figure 7).
Control cells of wildtype and DeltamleR were grown in neutral THBY before being transferred to pH 3.1 without L-malate.
Both strains showed no difference in the survival under these conditions (Figure 7).
To determine the influence of malate and the mleR regulator on the response of S. mutans to a rapid pH shift, both the wildtype and the mleR mutant were grown in neutral THBY and then subjected to pH 3.1 in the presence of 25 mM malate.
In both strains the number of surviving cells after 20 minutes was similar to the control (Figure 7).
However, after 40 minutes the number of viable cells increased significantly compared to the control in the wildtype.
Thus, the genes for MLF were induced within this time period and the conversion of malate contributed to the aciduricity.
Without a functional copy of mleR, the number of viable cells also increased after 40 minutes but to a much lesser extend compared to the wildtype.
This again shows that a shift to an acidic pH is satisfactory to induce the MLF genes in the absence of mleR.
When the mle genes were induced by low pH and L-malate in a preincubation step before transferring the cells to pH 3.1, an immediately increased viability was already seen 20 minutes after acid shock.
Again, the wildtype exhibited a significantly enhanced survival compared to the mleR knockout mutant.
The data show that the MLF genes are induced during the acid adaptation response but a functional copy of mleR in conjunction with its co-inducer L-malate is needed to achieve maximal expression.

Quantitative real time PCR showed an up-regulation of the adjacent gluthatione reductase upon the addition of 25 mM free malic acid (Figure 5).
Therefore, we tested the capability of S. mutans to survive exposure to 0.2 (v/v) hydrogen peroxide after incubation of cells in acidified THBY and malate to induce this gene.
However, no difference between wildtype and DeltamleR mutant was observed (data not shown).
