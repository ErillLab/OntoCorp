Microarray analysis of the gonococcal FNR regulon

To determine the range of functions regulated by FNR in N. gonorrhoeae, the fnr+ parental strain, RUG7001, and its isogenic fnr mutant, RUG7022, were grown in poorly aerated cultures until oxygen became limiting and aniA expression had been induced (as indicated by the disappearance of nitrite from the medium).
The fnr+ parental strain grew exponentially until the nitrite had been reduced.
In contrast, the fnr mutant grew at a constant rather than an exponential rate that was similar to the oxygen-limited growth of the parental strain in the absence of nitrite (Fig. 1).
To distinguish between genes differentially expressed in response to growth rate from those regulated directly by FNR in response to oxygen limitation, RNA was extracted from the fnr+ parental strain grown in the presence or absence of nitrite, and from the fnr mutant grown in the presence of nitrite.
These RNA preparations were analysed using two pair wise comparisons: fnr+ gonococci growing exponentially in the presence of nitrite compared to the fnr mutant; and fnr+ gonococci growing in the absence of nitrite compared to the fnr mutant.
Data were analysed according to fold-change (> 2-fold difference between the two strains) and a Student's t-test, using a cut-off p value of 0.01, reflecting the fact that six biological replicates were used in this experiment.
Fourteen transcripts were more abundant in the parental strain than the fnr mutant, while six were more abundant in the mutant, suggesting FNR repression (Table 1).
Five of the transcripts were more abundant in the fnr+ strain during growth in both the presence and absence of nitrite, suggesting direct FNR regulation.
The most up-regulated transcripts encode a short transcript of unknown function (46.3-fold, p 1.1 x 10-5 with nitrite; 73.06-fold, p 7.3 x 10-6 without nitrite), and a putative iron uptake outer membrane protein designated OmpU (NGO1688; 12.27-fold, p 3.2 x 10-4 with nitrite; 6.6-fold, p 7.3 x 10-5 without nitrite) [[9]; see also comments in the Entrez nucleotide entry for N. meningitidis ompU, accession AF118122].
Also activated were the nitrite reductase gene, aniA (6.02-fold, p 1.9 x 10-5 with nitrite; 3.56-fold, p 8.2 x 10-4 without nitrite), NGO1215 encoding a highly conserved hypothetical protein (4.57-fold, p 4.8 x 10-4 with nitrite; 3.52-fold, p 3.2 x 10-5 without nitrite); and NGO0546 encoding the Res subunit of a Type III restriction-modification system similar to the EcoPI enzyme (2.31-fold, p 2.1 x 10-3 with nitrite; 2.88-fold, p 5.2 x 10-5 without nitrite).
Nine further transcripts were more highly expressed in the fnr+ strain compared to the fnr mutant, but only during growth in the presence of nitrite.
These transcripts are possibly regulated in response to growth rate rather than by FNR.
Only one of these genes, NGO0602, encoding a putative MerR-family transcription regulator, was also more highly expressed in the fnr+ strain grown in the absence of nitrite (2.8-fold), but the regulation of this gene was not as statistically significant (p 0.05).

Most down-regulated by FNR was the NGO1716 transcript encoding a putative phosphotransferase (COG3178; 0.14-fold, p 9.6 x 10-6 with nitrite; 0.18-fold, p 8.1 x 10-6 without nitrite), followed by two genes implicated in nitric oxide metabolism, dnrN (0.37-fold, p 0.12 with nitrite; 0.19-fold, p 8.4 x 10-6 without nitrite), and norB (0.6-fold, p 0.84 with nitrite; 0.28-fold, p 2.9 x 10-3 without nitrite).
Two transcripts were less abundant in the parental strain during growth in the presence of nitrite: cysteine synthetase (cysK gene; NGO0340; 0.29-fold, p 7.3 x 10-3); and glnQ (NGO0374) encoding a component of an ABC-type amino acid transporter (0.47-fold; p 3.4 x 10-4).
The transcript for a Neisseria-specific protein encoded by NGO1428 was more abundant in the mutant only in the absence of nitrite (0.49-fold, p 2.6 x 10-4).
These data are summarized in Table 1.

The results of the microarray experiments can be interactively interrogated in an on-line graphical GBrowse database at , where the fold ratio, number of observations for each gene, Student's t-test, Cyber-T p-values, XNG and NGO annotations, and the microarray probe locations can be visualized, and searched using chromosomal locations, gene names, or gene identifiers.
The results from each experiment can be viewed individually or in combination to compare the results, and users can add their own local annotations.
The results of these experiments can also be seen in direct comparison with the expression data obtained in a previous microarray study addressing expression associated with narPQ [10].



Bioinformatic and ChIP analysis of promoters of genes differentially expressed in the fnr mutant

Putative FNR binding sites with at least a 7/10 match to the E. coli consensus, TTGATNNNNATCAA, were identified within 200 base pairs upstream of the translation start codon of eleven of the genes revealed by the microarray experiments to be differentially expressed in the fnr mutant and its parent (Table 1).
A strain containing a chromosomal fnr-3xFLAG fusion was constructed (N. gonorrhoeae strain JCGC502), grown microaerobically both in the presence and absence of nitrite to the late exponential phase, DNA-binding proteins were cross linked to the chromosome, the bacteria were lysed and chromosomal DNA was sheared.
Anti-FLAG antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate FNR-DNA complexes, which were de-crosslinked and the DNA released was purified.
The quantity of each promoter fragment in the immunoprecipitated DNA pool was measured by realtime PCR, relative to the FNR-independent hpt promoter.
Promoter fragments enriched 60% or more in at least two independent experiments scored positive (Table 1).

Only one of the fourteen genes potentially activated by FNR had previously been reported to be FNR-dependent: aniA, encoding a nitrite reductase [5,6].
Consistent with the microarray data reported above, FNR binding to PaniA was confirmed by ChIP, providing a positive control for the ChIP data.
The ChIP experiments also confirmed FNR-binding to the promoter regions of the most highly FNR-activated transcript (NMB1205) and ompU.
Although the ompU promoter has no recognisable FNR binding site, multiple potential half-sites are present in the promoter region.
Conversely, even though open reading frames NGO1215 and NGO0546 have potential FNR binding sites upstream, FNR binding was not detected by ChIP.
This emphasises that caution is required when drawing conclusions from data based upon either of these techniques alone.



Proteomic analysis of the FNR regulon

A study of protein expression in fnr+ and fnr gonococci revealed fewer differences than were identified in the microarray study.
Comparison of the cytoplasmic proteins of the fnr+ parental strain, RUG7001, and the fnr mutant, strain RUG7022, grown in the presence of nitrite revealed no significant differences in protein expression (data not shown).
In contrast, three membrane proteins were more abundant in the fnr+ strain: nitrite reductase, AniA; nitric oxide reductase, NorB; and the septum site-determining cell division protein, MinD [11].
Although norB transcription is independent of FNR [12], more NorB accumulated during nitrite reduction by the fnr+ strain than in the fnr mutant.
The explanation for this apparent contradiction is that transcription from the norB promoter is induced by NO [9,12], so because AniA is not synthesised in the mutant, no NO would be generated to activate the expression of norB.
As the microarray data did not identify minD expression to be activated by FNR, the apparent differential expression of MinD protein, revealed by proteomic analysis, is more likely to be due to a growth rate effect than to a direct effect of FNR.



Effects of iron deprivation and peroxide stress on an fnr mutant

In light of the altered expression of the genes associated with iron transport (ompU and the putative NRAMP family member NGO1455) it was determined whether FNR is important in metal ion uptake.
The ability of a gonococcal fnr mutant to survive metal ion limitation was tested.
Microaerobically grown fnr mutant and parent were treated with 200 muM dipyridyl, a chelator of iron and manganese ions.
Viable counts made at regular intervals for up to one hour showed there was no significant difference in survival between the fnr+ and fnr gonococci.

Considering that genes predicted to be involved in defence against ROS (ccp [7]) or induced upon exposure to ROS (NGO1428 and NGO1716 [13]) were observed to be regulated by FNR, the ability of an fnr mutant to survive oxidative stress was tested.
Oxygen-limited cultures of gonococci, both the fnr mutant and the parental strain, were subjected to 10 mM hydrogen peroxide.
Viable counts taken at intervals up to one hour showed, as with the metal chelation experiment, no significant difference in survival between the fnr+ and fnr bacteria.



Why cytochrome c peroxidase was not identified as being FNR-regulated by microarray analysis

Expression of the cytochrome c peroxidase is activated by FNR in response to oxygen [5].
Mature CCP protein was detected by staining gonococcal whole cell or membrane proteins separated by SDS-PAGE for haem-dependent peroxidase activity.
However, in the present microarray study, FNR-dependent expression of the ccp gene was not observed because of the low level of expression of ccp.
The quantity of ccp transcript was not sufficient to generate a statistically significant signal above the background signal of the slide, and was filtered out at the pON filter stage of data analysis.

To confirm that the ccp gene is regulated by FNR, and to compare the relative activity of the ccp and aniA promoters, N. gonorrhoeae strains RUG7001, carrying a chromosomal aniA::lacZ fusion, and JCGC201 & JCGC202, fnr+ and fnr derivatives carrying ccp::lacZ, were grown microaerobically in gonococcal broth (GCB) in the presence and absence of nitrite and assayed for beta-galactosidase activity after 4, 5, 6, and 7 hours of growth (Figure 2).
Far less beta-galactosidase activity accumulated in the ccp::lacZ fnr mutant strain than in the fnr+ strain, and the beta-galactosidase activity of the fnr+ strain was higher in the absence than in the presence of nitrite.
During growth in the absence of nitrite, at an OD650 of around 0.5 (corresponding to 0.2 g bacterial dry weight l-1), FNR activated Pccp 24-fold.
These data support the previously reported observation that ccp expression is repressed by the presence of nitrite in an fnr+ strain [7].
Furthermore, expression of ccp was observed to be FNR-dependent in quantitative real time PCR experiments in which transcript levels in fnr mutant and wild-type strains were compared.
Whereas in the parental strain ccp expression was induced 18-fold during oxygen limited growth, there was no induction of ccp expression in the fnr mutant strain.
These data confirm that, while the ccp gene is not included in the list of FNR-activated genes from the microarray data due to low expression levels, the ccp promoter is activated by FNR.
In addition, the ccp promoter was enriched in ChIP experiments, so was shown to bind FNR in vivo.
However, these control ccp experiments illustrate a rarely documented weakness of microarray experiments, namely the problem of false negative results that, due to over-stringent use of statistical analysis, might lead to under-estimation of the number of differentially expressed genes.
It also illustrates the utility of an analytical approach that incorporates exclusion of data for transcripts that do not generate detectable signals; so that those genes below the detectable thresholds are readily identified, rather than using 'flooring' or other methods for filling in low intensity or empty microarray data fields.



The gonococcal NarQP cannot complement an E. coli narQP mutation

The microarray data revealed fundamental differences between the FNR regulons of E. coli and N. gonorrhoeae, not least in that the gonococcal FNR regulon is very small compared with its E. coli counterpart.
However, in both organisms, expression of the major nitrite reductases is co-activated by FNR and a two-component regulatory system, NarQ-NarP, that bind to similar target sequences located at almost identical positions relative to the respective transcription start sites (PaniA in N. gonorrhoeae; PnirB in E. coli [5,6,14-18]).
We have previously demonstrated that a single amino acid substitution is sufficient to enable the gonococcal FNR to complement an E. coli fnr mutation.
It was therefore of interest to determine whether the gonococcal NarQ-NarP could complement E. coli mutants defective in both NarXL and NarQP.

The gonococcal narQP genes were expressed in E. coli under the control of the E. coli fnr promoter from plasmid pGCNarQP, and the ability of the gonococcal NarQP proteins to activate the E. coli nirB promoter was assessed [19].
Expression of the E. coli nitrite reductase NirBD is activated by FNR in response to oxygen limitation and by NarQP in response to the availability of nitrate or nitrite [20].
E. coli strains JCB386 (nirB::lacZ), JCB3861 (nirB::lacZ narXL), JBC3863 (nirB::lacZ narXLQP), and JCB3863 transformed with pGCNarQP were grown anaerobically in the presence or absence of 5 mM NaNO2 or 20 mM NaNO3 and beta-galactosidase activities measured (Table 2A).

In E. coli strain JCB386, the nirB promoter is activated in response to both nitrite and nitrate.
Activation in the presence of nitrite is reduced in strain JCB3861, which lacks NarXL.
In the narXLQP strain JCB3863, nirB activity is very low in all three growth conditions, since NarQP is required for activation in the presence of nitrite or nitrate.
When transformed with pGCNarQP, strain JCB3863 has similarly low beta-galactosidase activities in all three conditions.
Expression of the gonococcal narQP genes from pGCNarQP was verified by RT-PCR (data not shown).
Therefore, it was concluded that gonococcal NarQP cannot complement an E. coli narXLQP mutation at PnirB.



Ligand sensing and signal transduction characteristics of the gonococcal NarQ

Only a very limited range of genetic techniques are available to investigate sensor kinases and response regulators by site-directed mutagenesis and gene deletions in the gonococcus.
However, as some sensor kinases have been shown to phosphorylate response regulators of a heterologous host [21,22], the ability of gonococcal NarQ to phosphorylate the E. coli NarP protein was assessed to investigate the ligand sensing and signal transduction characteristics of the gonococcal NarQ and NarP proteins.
Strain JCB391 (narXL narQ) and JCB391 transformed with pBADgcQ, expressing gonococcal narQ, each co-transformed with pRNW15 carrying napF::lacZ, were grown anaerobically in the presence or absence of nitrate and nitrite and their beta-galactosidase activities determined (Table 2B).
The NarP-dependent napF promoter was not activated during growth in the presence of nitrite and nitrate in strain JCB391, since the NarQ sensor kinase was not present and NarP was unable to become phosphorylated, but was activated constitutively in strain JCB391 expressing the gonococcal NarQ from pBADgcQ.
The explanation for this observation is that the gonococcal NarQ was constitutively phosphorylating the E. coli NarP protein, which was activating transcription.
This was the first indication that the gonococcal NarQ sensor kinase might be ligand-insensitive and constitutively active in E. coli.

Expression of the E. coli fumarate reductase operon, frdABCD, is activated by FNR in response to oxygen limitation but repressed by NarL in response to the availability of nitrate or nitrite [23].
Due to the absence of a 7-2-7 inverted repeat sequence (where the 7 bases are the NarL heptamer), NarP is unable to bind at this promoter [24].
If the gonococcal NarQ is constitutively active, it should also be able to activate E. coli NarL and hence repress transcription at Pfrd.
Strain JCB12 (frdA::lacZ narXQ) and strain JCB12 transformed with pBADgcQ expressing gonococcal NarQ, were grown anaerobically in the presence or absence of nitrate and nitrite and their beta-galactosidase activities were determined (Table 2C).
The frdA promoter was activated in all three conditions in strain JCB12, but was repressed in all three conditions by strain JCB12 expressing the gonococcal NarQ from pBADgcQ, as expected if the gonococcal NarQ was continually phosphorylating the E. coli NarL protein and therefore constitutively active in E. coli.



Mutations in the P-box of E. coli NarQ do not alter ligand specificity

Previous studies have revealed residues in a periplasmic region of the E. coli NarQ and NarX proteins, the P-box, that are important for ligand sensing and discrimination between nitrate and nitrite [25-28].
Only ten of the 18 residues that comprise the gonococcal P-box are the same as those of either the E. coli NarQ or NarX proteins.
Four residues are proposed to be important for ligand discrimination in E. coli NarX (H45, K49, R54 and R59); substitutions at any of these residues result in NarX proteins with altered ligand sensing characteristics [28].
Of these four, only R59 is conserved in the gonococcal NarQ.
The residue in gonococcal NarQ corresponding to R54 is a lysine; an R54K substitution in E. coli NarX results in a ligand-insensitive phenotype.
To determine whether the differences in the P-box of gonococcal NarQ determined nitrite specificity, the E. coli NarQ P-box was mutated to resemble the gonococcal P-box (Table 3).
Mutated NarQ proteins were expressed in E. coli strains mutated in narX and narQ and their ability to activate nirB::lacZ or repress frdA::lacZ chromosomal fusions was assessed using beta-galactosidase assays (Table 3).
Substitutions in both single and multiple residues resulted in NarQ proteins that were inactive and ligand insensitive, a "locked-off" phenotype.
