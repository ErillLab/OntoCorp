3.1.Accurate mapping of known Spo0J-binding sites by ChAP-chip analysis

Previously, we developed a method to purify in vivo complexes of cell division proteins using a 12 x histidine- tag under denatured conditions.30 
We anticipated that the procedure is similarly effective for the purification of in vivo DNA - protein complexes.
To verify the sensitivity of the tag-based chromatin precipitation protocol, we initially examined the binding sites of Spo0J involved in chromosome partitioning in B. subtilis.
Spo0J binds at eight specific positions (parS sites) on the genome, as observed from the identified binding consensus sequences and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis.31 
We expressed the Spo0J protein fused to a histidine tag at the C-terminus using SI002 cells.
During exponential growth in LB medium under aerobic conditions, Spo0J-12 x His-expressing cells were treated with formaldehyde to cross-link protein and genome DNA, and disrupted by sonication in 8 M urea buffer to generate an average DNA fragment size of ~500 bp.
Protein - DNA complexes were purified with the Ni2+-resin under denatured conditions, and the cross-links removed by heat treatment.
DNA fragments co-purified with Spo0J were hybridized with a high-density tiling chip.
The hybridization intensities of Spo0J-associated DNA to each oligonucleotide probe on the chip are presented in Fig. 2 (see also detailed map in Supplementary Fig. S2).
Our ChAP-chip analysis clearly shows that Spo0J forms a stable complex at eight regions, consistent with previous results.31 
Spo0J-binding signals are more broadly distributed than those of DnaA, as described below (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2).
This result is consistent with the recent finding that Spo0J is associated with several kilobases of DNA flanking its specific binding sites (parS) through a parS-dependent nucleation event that promotes lateral spreading along the chromosome.37 
Thus, it appears that our ChAP-chip method is sufficiently sensitive to detect the in vivo interaction sites of DNA-binding proteins.



3.2.Identification of high-affinity binding sites of DnaA

To identify the DnaA-binding sites on the B. subtilis genome, DnaA was expressed as a fusion protein with a 12 x histidine-tag by the authentic promoter using SI003 cells, and ChAP-chip analysis performed.
The hybridization profiles of DnaA-associated DNA clearly disclose eight stable binding sites for DnaA on the B. subtilis genome (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2).
Interestingly, binding sites are mapped only in the intergenic regions (between rpmH - dnaA, dnaA - dnaN, yqeG - sda, ywlB - ywlC, jag - thdF, yycS - yydA, ywcI - vpr, and gcp - ydiF).
Gene organization surrounding the eight binding sites, location of the DnaA boxes, and detailed DnaA-binding signals are depicted in Fig. 3, and the functions of the surrounding genes are summarized in Table 1.
The regions upstream and downstream of dnaA, rpmH - dnaA (oriC1), and dnaA - dnaN (oriC2) comprise cis-acting sequences essential for the initiation of chromosome replication,34 and the upstream sequence contains the dnaA promoter that is repressed by the corresponding translated protein.6 
Expression of sda is dependent on DnaA binding to the upstream sequence,22,23 and promoters of ywlC and yydA were reported to be negatively regulated by DnaA.23 
Multiple DnaA boxes upstream of thdF were identified 17 years ago,38 but with no evidence of actual DnaA binding.
Our results additionally suggest a possibility that DnaA regulates the expression of vpr and/or ywcI - secT.
Binding to the gcp - ydiF region is uncharacteristic for transcriptional regulation, as it is located at the 3' end of convergent gcp and ydiF genes.

DnaA protein binds to single DnaA box in vitro.39,40 
However, the DnaA-binding regions identified here contain multiple DnaA boxes.
These results suggest that the ChAP-chip analysis can be effectively used to detect stable DnaA - DNA complexes, but not transient or weak binding to dispersed DnaA boxes.



3.3.Effect of DnaA overproduction and depletion on transcription of genes surrounding the stable binding sites

To establish the function of DnaA binding to sequences other than oriC, we examined transcriptional profiles in DnaA-overproducing and -depleted cells using the high-density tiling chip employed for ChAP-chip analysis.
To this end, we employed NIS2022 cells with an IPTG-inducible dnaA - dnaN operon at the purA locus, and inactivated the authentic dnaA gene by introducing orcher mutations.6 
Expression of the DnaA protein in NIS2022 cells is reduced to One-fifth that in non-induced conditions (0 microM IPTG), and increases fivefold upon induction with 100 microM IPTG, compared with the DnaA concentration in wild-type cells.6 
Notably, under both non-induced and induced conditions, no apparent growth defects were observed, and the overall profiles of gene expression remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Transcriptional initiation from the authentic promoter of dnaA is clearly repressed upon induction of DnaA expression, and stimulated slightly under non-induced conditions (Fig. 4A).
This finding is in agreement with a previous study reporting autoregulation of dnaA.6
A similar change in transcription was observed for the intergenic region between dnaA and dnaN.
The dependence of sda expression on DnaA is well characterized.22,23 
We observed sda expression and repression in DnaA-induced and non-induced conditions, respectively (Fig. 4B).
Interestingly, we identified another transcript covering the sda gene, but on the non-coding strand.
The newly identified transcript was weakly, but significantly repressed by overexpressed DnaA at the DnaA-binding site.
We additionally observed weak, but significant repression of ywlC, yydA, and thdF-gidA-gidB-noc transcription in DnaA-induced cells (Fig. 4C - E), although their de-repression in non-induced cells was not apparent.
A sufficient amount of DnaA is present in cells to support growth at a normal rate, even under non-induced conditions, thus those genes may still be repressed by DnaA.
The suppression of ywlC and yydA expression by DnaA is in accordance with reported microarray data.23 
We have demonstrated DnaA-regulated expression of thdF-gidA-gidB-noc by northern blot analysis using NIS2022 cells (Ogura et al., unpublished result).
These transcriptional alterations were reproducible in two independent experiments (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Additionally, the DnaA level affected rocA, rocD, and yvdCD expression positively, and ykuNOP and dhbA expression negatively (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S2).
The molecular mechanisms and biological significance of these changes are currently unclear.
On the other hand, the effects of DnaA on the expression of genes around ywcI - vpr and gcp - ydiF could not be distinguished due to weak expression.



3.4.Sequence characteristics of stable DnaA-binding sites on the chromosome

Next, we explored the characteristics defining the stable DnaA-binding sites in the B. subtilis genome.
Bacillus subtilis DnaA recognizes DnaA boxes in E. coli oriC, and vice versa, in vitro.
Although the numbers and arrangement of DnaA boxes in oriC are different in B. subtilis and E. coli, the oriC regions were incompatible with each other in vivo.39,40 
Recently, the crystal structure of the DNA-binding domain of E. coli DnaA complexed with a DnaA box (TTATCCACA) was resolved.41 
In the complex, amino acids R399, P423, D433, H434, T435, and H439 form base-specific interactions, and are essential for sequence recognition by DnaA.
Interestingly, these residues are conserved in B. subtilis DnaA, indicating that DNA-binding specificities are similar for B. subtilis and E. coli DnaA.
Thus, we assume that the consensus sequence of the B. subtilis DnaA box is TTATNCACA, similar to the E. coli protein, and allow one base mismatch for identifying DnaA boxes.
As shown in Fig. 3, stable DnaA-binding sites contain multiple boxes, as observed in oriC sequences of eubacteria.42 Initially, we evaluated the density of DnaA boxes along the genome, using a modified method of0 Mackiewicz et al.42 
The density of DnaA box distribution was presented on charts as b = 1/d, calculated for each box, where d is the average distance between adjacent DnaA boxes.
Mackiewicz and colleagues calculated the b value for three successive DnaA boxes (average of two distances), whereas we additionally calculated for four and five successive boxes, with no clear correlation with the identified binding sites.
Recently, the DnaA-binding affinity to DnaA boxes with different fifth nucleotides was evaluated in E. coli cells and the affinity was found to decrease in the order: C > A = G > T.43
Accordingly, we assigned the binding affinities as 4, 2, 1.5, 1, and 1 for TTATCCACA, TTATACACA, TTATAGACA, TTATATACA, and other DnaA boxes (having one base mismatch from TTATNCACA), and the binding affinity of DnaA for four successive DnaA boxes was expressed as A = (sum of affinities of four successive DnaA boxes)/d.
As the result, we found that the A value is well correlated with the DnaA-binding sites; eight binding sites identified here exclusively have A value >0.3 (Fig. 5A).
Sequence characteristics of the eight DnaA-binding regions, including number of DnaA boxes and the A value, are summarized in Table 2.
Our results suggest that two factors, specifically, closely clustered DnaA boxes of probably four or more, and the affinity of DnaA boxes for the protein, are essential for stable DnaA-binding in B. subtilis cells.



3.5.Distribution of probable DnaA-binding sites in other Bacillus species

We estimated the stable DnaA-binding sites in the genome sequences of other Bacillus species, using the defined A value.
Interestingly, regions with high A values locate in a similar arrangement on the genome in all the bacteria examined (Fig. 5B - I).
However, close examination of possible DnaA-binding regions in various Bacillus species revealed their conserved and diverse characteristics (Table 3).
As expected, multiple DnaA-binding sequences upstream and downstream of dnaA (oriC) are essentially conserved in all bacteria.
Notably, in B. licheniformis, the dnaA - dnaN region contains only three DnaA boxes, and its A value is below the threshold.
DnaA-binding sequences upstream of sda, ywlC, and yydA are also present in most bacteria, supporting the biological significance of DnaA-mediated regulation of these genes.
Interestingly, a DnaA box cluster downstream of gcp is highly conserved, although its biological role is not clear at present.
On the other hand, DnaA box cluster upstream of the thdF-gidA-gidB-noc operon is not conserved, although those genes are conserved in all bacteria examined (Table 3), thus the DnaA-dependent expression of the operon appears not to be general.
Similarly, DnaA box clusters upstream of vpr are present in limited bacteria.
In addition, other possible DnaA-binding regions (colored red in Fig. 5B - I) that are absent in B. subtilis have been identified.
Interestingly, DnaA-binding regions with a high A value are generally located near oriC in all the bacteria examined.
