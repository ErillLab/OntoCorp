Isolation of R.etli promoter sequences

To determine the general structure of the R.etli promoters, a random genomic library with an average insert size of 0.5 kb was constructed in the promoter-test vector pBBMCS53 and introduced by conjugation into R.etli CFN42.
Direct screening on PY plates containing X-Gluc allowed the selection of transconjugants with an active reporter gene (gusA), suggesting that the constructs contained R.etli promoter regions.
The beta-glucuronidase activity of 100 transconjugans was determined in PY liquid cultures in exponential and stationary phases of growth.
Sixty-eight of these clones showed beta-glucuronidase activity under both conditions, while the remaining 32 transconjugants expressed the reporter gene only in PY plates, and for this reason were not used in further experiments.
The ability to express the reporter gene of the 68 strains described above was tested in different conditions: low oxygen (1%), minimal medium (MM) and at different temperatures (30, 42 or -10 degrees C).
All but three expressed the reporter gene in all conditions, but at different levels, suggesting that the transconjugants carry constructs with constitutive promoters.
The DNA sequences of 36 inserts of these constructs were determined.
These promoter sequences, plus seven R.etli promoters experimentally identified in other studies were selected for subsequent analyses (30 - 35).

Thirty-three promoters were mapped within intergenic regions; eight within the coding regions of the immediately preceeding gene, and three in DNA sections that contained overlapped coding regions.

The genetic compartments of the 44 promoters of our collection were next: thirty-nine were located on the chromosome, two on plasmid p42d and one in each of these plasmids: p42b, p42e and p42f.



Identification of transcriptional start-sites

The transcription start-sites are good reference points to identify the upstream conserved sequence characteristics of the promoters.
Thus, the 5' ends of the mRNAs synthesized from each of the selected 36 promoter regions selected, were successfully identified by 5' RACE using the total RNA isolated from PY cultures in exponential growth conditions of the transconjugants.
In general, a single RT - PCR product was obtained, but in one clone, two conspicuous amplification products were observed.
In this case the bands were independently isolated, cloned and sequenced, showing that these products are transcripts associated to the same gene.

Thirty-eight of the transcription start-sites (86%) fell within the first 250 bp upstream from coding regions, and four transcription start-sites corresponded to the nucleotide A of the start codon ATG from their respective ORF (Table 2).



Determination of a promoter consensus sequence

The promoter consensus sequence was derived by aligning 50 bp upstream from the transcription start-site of each promoter region.
The identification of -10 and -35 boxes was corroborated with the WCONSENSUS program as described in Materials and Methods.
As shown in Figure 1a, over-represented nucleotides clearly appeared around the -35 region and, in a lesser degree, in the -10 region.
Then, the putative -10 consensus box [TATNNT] showed four identical positions to the -10 box of the E.coli consensus promoter [TATAAT] recognized by sigma70 factor.
The 3' end of the R.etli -10 consensus boxes was positioned from 3 to 10 bp upstream from the transcriptional start-site (Figure 1c).
Six promoter regions (14%) showed the dinucleotide [TG] in positions -15 and -14, which resembled the structure of the E.coli -10 extended promoter.
The -35 box consensus sequence [CTTGAC], is identical in five positions to the equivalent box of the E.coli consensus promoter [TTGACA] recognized by sigma70.
The spacing between the -35 and -10 regions ranges from 16 to 23 bp (Figure 1b).
The promoter sequences contain 6.4 conserved bases on average, of the 12 conforming -10 and -35.

Suboptimal promoters were identified in 11 of the 44 promoter regions as shown in Figure 1a, but they were not taken in account to generate the consensus promoter sequence for the following reasons: none of them contained both hexameric boxes recognized by the best statistic parameters of WCONSENSUS.
Nevertheless, in six of these promoters the -35 box overlapped with one proposed by us.
In one case the -10 box overlapped the region proposed here.
Moreover, some of the suboptimal promoters contained the spacer region two long (up to 27 bp) or to short (11 or 12 bp).
In two cases the transcription start-sites were located far of the -10 boxes (up to 20 bp).

The results presented here showed that the R.etli promoter consensus possesses some similarities with the E.coli promoter consensus recognized by the sigma70 factor, but the variability in the nucleotide frequency in each position of the consensus was greater than that observed in E.coli promoters (7).



Thermodynamic properties of the R.etli promoter regions

It was recently demonstrated in several bacteria genomes, that the intergenic regions containing promoters are generally less stable and less flexible than coding regions (36).
To determine if these thermodynamic properties are also present in the promoter regions of R.etli, the stacking energy and the double helix stability were evaluated in our collection of 44 promoters.
For this analysis the sequence of 200 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream from transcription start-site of all members of the promoter collection were taken in account.
As an internal control, a set similar in size and length was constructed with the immediately downstream coding region of each member of the promoter collection.
The same properties were predicted and contrasted with two E.coli equivalent sets: one containing 44 randomly chosen promoter sequences experimentally characterized and putatively recognized by sigma70, and the other of 44 coding region sequences that corresponded to the genes controlled by the selected promoters.
As shown in Figure 2a, the distribution profiles of double helix stability for coding and no coding regions of R.etli were similar, however, a significative local minimum around the -10 element was detected in our collection of promoter regions.
The average stability of the E.coli coding regions was higher than the average stability of their promoter regions, and like R.etli, a prominent feature of the promoter regions was a minimum stability around the -10 box (Figure 2b).

The stacking energy profiles of R.etli and E.coli promoter regions were variable, but with a tendency to low negative values (low stability), nevertheless local minimum values were located around the -10 box.
In contrast, the stacking energy profiles of R.etli and E.coli coding regions were similar: both showed more negative values that corresponded to great stability (Figure 2a and b).
These results suggest that despite the variability in the nucleotide composition of R.etli promoters, these regions possess thermodynamic and structural properties similar to the E.coli promoter regions.



Promoter sequence mutagenesis

To demonstrate that the promoter consensus proposed here is correct, the DNA sequence of three R.etli mutant promoters (from repA, the antisense RNA gene present in the p42d repABC operon and recA) with the reduced transcriptional activity previously characterized was located in our alignment.
As shown in Figure 3, these mutations fall in the regions centred in -10 and -35 of the consensus, suggesting that these elements were correctly identified.

Additionally the promoter consensus was verified in the following way: the constitutive promoter (phemC) of hemC, a gene encoding a porphobilinogen deaminase protein, was selected for a mutagenic analysis.
This promoter possessed five conserved positions from consensus and showed moderate activity.
Three mutant derivatives were constructed that deviated the promoter sequence from the consensus.
First, the putative -35 element was altered, changing sequence [ATTGCG] to [AAGACG] to generate the construct pGUSphemC-35.
Second, the putative -10 element was changed from [TACGAG] to [GCGGAG] to produce construct pGUSphemC-10.
Third, the putative wild-type -35 and -10 elements were changed at the same time to the sequences indicated before, to generate plasmid pGUSphemC-1035.
These constructs were introduced into R.etli CFN42, and the beta-glucuronidase activities of the transconjugants were determined.
As shown in Figure 3, all mutant constructs showed a low level of beta-glucuronidase activity, indicating that the -35 and -10 elements of the R.etli promoter consensus were correctly identified.



Activity of the R.etli promoters in E.coli

As described in the previous section, the R.etli sigma70 promoter consensus sequence is more variable than that described for E.coli.
This observation suggests that the E.coli sigma70 is unable to recognize the R.etli promoters or recognizes them less efficiently.
To prove this possibility, the 36 transcriptional fusions of the collection were introduced into the BW21038 (gusA) strain, and their beta-glucuronidase activities were evaluated in plates supplemented with X-Gluc.
In this experiment only three promoters were functional, but showed low beta-glucuronidase activity.
These results suggest that the 33 transcriptional fusions are poorly or unrecognized by the E.coli sigma factors.
It is possible than the E.coli sigma70 is incapable of binding the R.etli promoters because it is more stringent in its recognition pattern, and imposes a strict functional barrier.
If this hypothesis is true, then the R.etli sigma70 (SigA) activates the transcriptional fusions described above in E.coli.
To demonstrate this, all strains containing the gusA fusions were transformed with a plasmid expressing the R.etli sigma70 gene under the control of the lac promoter and the beta-glucuronidase activity of the transformants were evaluated in LB plates containing X-Gluc.
Representative results are shown in Figure 4.
The expression of sigA allowed the gusA fusions to express their reporter gene in the 36 R.etli promoter regions studied here, however, the strains containing sigA constructs were unstable, and a mixure of blue and white colonies was observed in the plates (Figure 4).
The results suggest that R.etli sigma70 is responsible for the transcriptional activity of these promoters, and that the structural variability of R.etli promoters cannot be recognized by E.coli sigma70.



The E.coli sigma70 is incapable of binding in vitro R.etli promoters

To verify if the R.etli promoters are recognized by the E.coli sigma70 factor, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) experiments were done using E.coli RNApol containing E.coli sigma70 and a PCR product containing the promoter of hemC gene (phemC), plus the PCR products of four promoter regions selected at random: ureA, cycH, yhch00197 and yhch00468.
As a negative control, a PCR product of a mutant derivative of promoter phemC containing the changes in the -10 and -35 elements described previously was used, and as a positive control, a PCR product containing the lac promoter was used (lac promoter is functional in R.etli).
Representative results are shown in Figure 5a.
In all experiments the E.coli RNApol holoenzyme was unable to bind the R.etli promoters tested, indicating that E.coli sigma70 cannot recognize R.etli promoters.



SigA binds in vitro R.etli promoters

To determine if SigA is capable of recognizing the R.etli promoters, binding shift experiments were done using a chimeric RNApol holoenzyme composed of E.coli RNApol core and R.etli sigma70 factor assembled in vitro.
As a target DNA, the PCR products containing the promoters mentioned above (phemC and the promoters of ureA, cycH, yhch00197 and yhch00468 genes) were used in these experiments.
Representative results are shown in Figure 5.
The chimeric RNApol holoenzyme bound the five PCR products, but at low efficiency (Figure 5b).
In contrast, no DNA binding shifts were observed using a PCR control with the mutant promoter phemC (Figure 5c).
These results showed that the chimeric RNApol holoenzyme specifically recognizes the R.etli promoters.



Comparative analysis of the sigma70 consensus sequences from different bacteria

The R.etli sigma70 promoter consensus was compared with those of the: (i) alpha-proteobacteria C.crescentus (G + C% of 67) (37) and Rhodobacter capsulatus (G + C% of 67) (38); (ii) the gamma-proteobacteria E.coli (G + C% of 52) (6); and (iii) B.subtilis (G + C% of 43) (39).
In the promoter consensus sequences of C.crescentus, R.capsulatus and R.etli, the -35 boxes are more conserved than the -10 boxes (Figure 6).
Furthermore, the inspection of the all sequences showed that each bacterial species has a consensus sequence, with a different degree of variability.
The R.etli and R.capsulatus promoters contain 6.4 and 5.0 conserved bases on average, respectively, less conserved in comparison with the promoter consensus of C.crescentus, that contains 8.0, E.coli 7.9 and B.subtilis 9.1 conserved nucleotides (7,39,40).
Finally, the number of conserved nucleotides, especially in the -10 box, tends to diminish when genomic G + C content is above 60%.
It is worth noting that the E.coli and B.subtilis -10 and -35 boxes are A + T rich and conserve 10 of 12 positions.
