T3SS1 genes of V. parahaemolyticus are transcribed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, but not transcribed in Luria - Bertani-salt media

Vibrio parahaemolyticus was grown in Luria - Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 2.5% sodium chloride [LB-salt (LB-S)] and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% FBS.
We selected 10 T3SS1 genes from the T3SS1 gene cluster to monitor gene expression by RT-PCR.
All 10 genes were transcribed when bacterial were grown in DMEM (Fig. 1).
Only exsD was clearly transcribed when bacterial were grown in LB-S (Fig. 1).
Vp1656, vp1670, vp1687 and vp1696 were very weakly transcribed (faint bands) when bacteria were grown in LB-S (Fig. 1).
Transcription of the house-keeping gene, secY, was similar for all culture conditions.
In the absence of reverse transcriptase, PCR results were negative, indicating no DNA contamination for these samples.
These results demonstrated that T3SS1 genes of V. parahaemolyticus are transcribed when cultured in DMEM.
Hereafter we refer to DMEM and LB-S as the inducing condition and non-inducing condition, respectively, for the transcription of T3SS1 genes.



ExsA is required for cytotoxicity induced by wild-type V. parahaemolyticus

Because ExsA is a positive regulator of T3SS genes in Pseudomonas, we determined if an exsA knockout is attenuated for cytotoxicity.
Cytotoxicity was determined by measuring the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release by HeLa cells after infection with V. parahaemolyticus strains.
Four hours after infection with the wild-type NY-4 strain, c. 95% of the HeLa cells were lysed, which is consistent with a previous report (X. Zhou, M.E. Konkel, and D.R. Call, submitted), while the DeltaexsA strain induced less than 5% of HeLa cell death (Fig. 2A).
HeLa cells infected with wild-type strain appeared rounded (Fig. 2C) while HeLa cell infected with DeltaexsA strain were similar to uninfected cells (Fig. D and data not shown).
To avoid the possibility that deletion of exsA had polar effects, we ectopically expressed ExsA-6xHis in a plasmid and measured if cytotoxicity was restored.
Western blot showed that the predicted protein was expressed in DeltaexsA complemented with an exsA plasmid (Fig. 2B, lane 3) and the complemented strain recovered the full phenotype with c.100% of the HeLa cells lysed after infection (Fig. 2A).
Cell rounding was also restored when HeLa cells were infected with complemented strain (Fig. 2E).
These results demonstrated that ExsA is required for V. parahaemolyticus to induce host cell death.



ExsA is required for the transcription of T3SS1 genes in DMEM and is sufficient to activate the transcription of T3SS1 genes in LB-S medium

Deletion of the exsA eliminated transcription of T3SS1 genes in the DMEM while expression of ExsA ectopically from a plasmid restored the transcription of T3SS1 genes (Fig. 3), indicating that ExsA is necessary for the transcription of T3SS1 genes in DMEM.
Ectopic expression of ExsA in the wild-type strain permitted the transcription of T3SS1 genes even when bacteria were grown in non-inducing medium (i.e. LB-S) (Fig. 3), indicating that ExsA is sufficient to activate the transcription of T3SS1 genes even when bacterial were grown in non-inducing conditions.
These results also indicate that T3SS1 transcriptional activation by environmental signals requires transcription of exsA.



ExsD is a negative regulator of T3SS1 genes of V. parahaemolyticus

Because exsD in Pseudomonas negatively regulates the transcription of T3SS genes, we determined if V. parahaemolyticus vp1698, the putative exsD homologue, has a similar function.
Deletion of exsD permitted transcription of T3SS1 genes when bacteria were grown in LB-S, indicating that transcriptional suppression of T3SS1 genes in non-inducing condition is due to the expression of exsD (Fig. 4).
To determine if T3SS1 genes of the DeltaexsD strain growing in LB-S are transcribed at levels comparable to the wild-type strain under inducing conditions, we diluted the cDNA templates from NY-4 strain growing in DMEM and DeltaexsD strain growing in LB-S and tested these dilutions using RT-PCR.
The results showed that the abundance of expression of each T3SS1 gene is similar between NY-4 growing in DMEM and DeltaexsD growing in LB-S, consistent with T3SS1 genes being transcribed at normal levels for the DeltaexsD strain grown in LB-S (Fig. S1).
To control for any polar effects of exsD deletion, the DeltaexsD strain was provided with a wild-type exsD-6xHis gene in trans and the ectopic expression of ExsD was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 2B, lane 4).
Complementation of DeltaexsD strain with a wild-type exsD restored inhibition of T3SS1 gene transcription in non-inducing conditions, indicating that expression of ExsD is sufficient to repress the transcription of T3SS1 genes in non-inducing condition (Fig. 4).
Ectopic expression of ExsD in the wild-type strain prevented transcription of T3SS1 genes when the bacteria were grown in DMEM.
Furthermore, ectopic expression of ExsD significantly reduced the ability of V. parahaemolyticus wild-type strain to induce host cell death (Fig. 2A and F).
These results demonstrated that ExsD is a negative regulator of T3SS1 gene transcription in V. parahaemolyticus.



ExsA but not ExsD binds the promoter sequences of vp1668 and vp1687

We determined if purified proteins ExsA and ExsD were able to bind the promoter sequences of T3SS1 genes.
We selected promoter regions upstream of vp1668 and vp1687 because these two regions have hypothetical binding motifs.
His-tagged recombinant ExsA, ExsD and Vp1656 proteins were purified to apparent homogeneity as shown by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie brilliant blue staining (Fig. S2).
Increasing amounts of protein ExsA and ExsD were mixed with ~180 bp PCR fragment encompassing the putative promoter region of vp1668 and vp1687.
Mixtures were size-fractionated by native acrylamide gel eletrophoresis, followed by ethidium bromide staining and visualization.
At lower concentrations of ExsA, a low-molecular-weight shifted band was observed while at higher concentrations of ExsA, another high-molecular-weight complex was detected for the promoters of vp1668 and vp1687 (Fig. 5A and B).
The negative control protein, Vp1656, did not bind the promoter of vp1668 (Fig. 5A).
Furthermore, when excessive DNA probe was used, a shifted band as well as an unshifted band (Fig. 5A) was detected, indicating that binding can be saturated.

To determine if ExsA binds to specific motif(s) within these two regions, DNA fragments with ~20 bp truncations at the 3' end (Fig. 5C and D, upper panel) were amplified and subjected to gel mobility shift assay.
For promoter vp1668, DNA fragments 1 - 4 have the ability to bind ExsA while fragments 5 - 8 lose the ability to bind ExsA (Fig. 5C), indicating that at least a portion of the last 22 bp segment of fragment 4 is necessary for ExsA binding.
For promoter vp1687, DNA fragments 1 - 4 bind ExsA while fragment 5 does not bind ExsA (Fig. 5D), indicating that at least a portion of the last 29 bp segment of fragment 4 is necessary for binding ExsA.
To exclude the possibility that product length affects the ability of ExsA to bind fragment 5 from vp1668 (128 bp), we generated a shorter DNA fragment 9 (112 bp) from 3' end of the promoter region encompassing the last 22 bp segment of fragment 4.
The results showed that fragment 9 is able to bind ExsA (Fig. 5C).
Thus, loss of binding is not related to the product length.
Because the last 22 bp of fragment 4 in vp1668 and the last 29 bp of fragment 4 in vp1687 share a consensus sequence, TTTAGN4TT, we replaced TTTAGGGCGTTT with CCCCCGGCGTCC (fragment 10) in vp1668 and replaced TTTAGCATATT with CCCCCCATACC (fragment 6) in vp1687.
The results showed that both fragment 10 of vp1668 and fragment 6 of vp1687 lost the ability to bind ExsA (Fig. 5C and D), indicating that TTTAGN4TT is the probable ExsA binding motif.
In addition, when we used a single concentration of ExsA, two shifted bands appeared in fragments 1 and 2 (possibly 3) of promoter vp1668 while the shifted band with higher molecular weight disappeared for fragments 3 - 8 (Fig. 5C).
When we tested fragment 9, the higher molecular weight band is again evident.
These data strongly suggest the presence of a second ExsA binding motif that is independent of the motif described above.
ExsD was mixed with promoter vp1668 and vp1687 and no shifted bands were observed (Fig. S3A and S3B), indicating that ExsD does not directly bind the promoter regions of vp1668 and vp1687.



Activity of promoter vp1668 and promoter exsA increases with inducing conditions

We characterized the promoter activity of vp1668 and exsA in different growth conditions and different strains.
For unknown reasons, we were unable to generate the single copy of transcriptional lacZ reporter fusion in the bacterial chromosome for promoter vp1687.
A single copy of promoters vp1668 - lacZ and exsA - lacZ was introduced into wild-type, DeltaexsA and DeltaexsD strains of V. parahaemolyticus, and beta-galactosidase activities were measured.
The activity of the promoter vp1668 increased five to six times when the wild-type strain of V. parahaemolyticus was grown in DMEM or after contact with HeLa cells respectively, compared with bacteria grown in LB-S (Fig. 6A).
The activity of the promoter exsA increased three to four times when wild-type strain of V. parahaemolyticus was grown in DMEM or contact with HeLa cells respectively, compared with bacteria grown in LB-S (Fig. 6B).
These results indicate that the promoter activity of vp1668 and exsA increases when the bacteria are grown in DMEM, and that contact with eukaryotic cells produces an additive effect.
Promoter activity of vp1668 in DeltaexsA strain was about five times less than the wild-type strain when bacteria were grown in DMEM, suggesting that ExsA is crucial for activating promoter vp1668.
Contact with HeLa cells did not increase the promoter activity of vp1668 in the DeltaexsA strain (Fig. 6A), indicating that eukaryotic contact does not override the requirement of ExsA for the activation of promoter vp1668.
The activity of promoter vp1668 in DeltaexsD strain increased approximately eight times compared with the wild-type strain when the bacteria were grown in LB-S (Fig. 6A), verifying that promoter activity of vp1668 is inhibited by ExsD when bacteria are grown in LB-S (Fig. 4).
Promoter activity of exsA in the DeltaexsA strain is similar to that of the wild-type strain when bacteria were grown in DMEM or contact with HeLa cells (Fig. 6B), indicating that exsA transcription is not affected by ExsA.
Finally, promoter activity of exsA in DeltaexsD strain increased about three times compared with that of the wild-type strain when bacteria were grown in LB-S, confirming an inhibitory role of ExsD in the expression of ExsA (Fig. 6B).



Expression and secretion of Vp1656 is regulated by ExsA and ExsD

Vp1656 was shown previously to be secreted by T3SS1 of V. parahaemolyticus (Park et al., 2004; Ono et al. 2006), so we determined if the expression and secretion of Vp1656 were regulated by ExsA and ExsD.
Polyclonal antibody against Vp1656 was generated by immunizing mice with the recombinant protein Vp1656 and the specificity of the polyclonal antibody was analysed by Western blot (Fig. 7A).
Two bands were detected in the DeltaexsD strain growing in LB-S while the lower band disappeared in the Deltavp1656 exsD mutant strain, consistent with the lower band being Vp1656 as specifically recognized by the polyclonal antibody while the upper band is a non-specific protein (Fig. 7A).
After the NY-4 strain was grown in DMEM for 2 h, Vp1656 was expressed (Fig. 7B, lane 12) while Vp1656 was not expressed when bacteria were grown in LB-S (Fig. 7B, lane 13).
Furthermore, expression of Vp1656 was increased after contact of wild-type strain with HeLa cells for 2 h compared with grown in DMEM (Fig. 7B, lane 11), confirming that eukaryotic cell contact acts in an additive manner on expression of Vp1656.
Interestingly, Vp1656 was not detected in the wild-type strain after 4 h of incubation in both DMEM and LB-S (data not shown).
We were not able to detect Vp1656 in the supernatant for the wild-type strain (Fig. 7C, lane 7 and 8).
This is possibly due to insufficient assay sensitivity for these conditions.
Vp1656 was not detected when the DeltaexsA strain was grown in DMEM for 2 h (Fig. 7B, lane 6; Fig. 7C, lane 3), or after contact with HeLa cells (Fig. 7B, lane 5).
These results indicate that ExsA is required for the expression of Vp1656 in DMEM and eukaryotic cell contact does not override the requirement of ExsA for the expression of Vp1656.
Ectopic expression of ExsA in the DeltaexsA strain and wild-type strain resulted in significant expression of Vp1656 (Fig. 7B, lanes 1 - 4; Fig. 7C, lanes 1 and 2).
Thus, ExsA is sufficient for the expression and secretion of Vp1656 even when bacteria were grown in the non-inducing condition.
Vp1656 was expressed and secreted in DeltaexsD strain (Fig. 7B, lane 10; Fig. 7C, lane 6) and complementation of DeltaexsD strain with a wild-type exsD gene in trans prevented Vp1656 expression and secretion when bacteria were grown in LB-S (Fig. 7B, lane 9; Fig. 7C, lane 5).
The wild-type strain provided with an exsD gene in trans blocked Vp1656 expression and secretion when bacteria were grown in DMEM or in contact with HeLa cells (Fig. 7B, lanes 7 and 8; Fig. 7C, lane 4).
Thus, ExsD is sufficient to repress the expression and secretion of Vp1656 and eukaryotic cell contact does not override the inhibitory role of ExsD.



Expression of T3SS1 genes in the absence of ExsD is ExsA-dependent

ExsA is required for the expression of T3SS1 genes in the wild-type strain grown under inducing conditions or after contact with HeLa cells (Figs 3 and 7).
We next determined if ExsA is also required for the exsD mutant strain to express T3SS1 genes when bacteria were grown in non-inducing condition.
T3SS1 genes were not transcribed in a DeltaexsA exsD double mutant strain growing in LB-S (Fig. 8A), while transcription of T3SS1 genes was detected when DeltaexsA exsD double mutant strain was provided with a wild-type exsA gene in trans.
As expected, transcription of exsD gene was not detected for both double mutant strain and the complemented strain (Fig. 8A).
After the DeltaexsA exsD double mutant strain was grown in LB-S, Vp1656 was not expressed (Fig. 8B, upper right panel) or secreted (Fig. 8B, lower right panel), while addition of the double mutant strain with a wild-type exsA gene in trans restored the expression (Fig. 8B, upper left panel) and secretion of Vp1656 (Fig. 8B, lower left panel).
These results indicated that expression of T3SS1 genes by DeltaexsD strain under non-inducing condition is dependent on ExsA.
These results also indicated that transcriptional activity of exsA is independent of ExsD.
