Identification of the promoter in the intergenic region between divergently transcribed pltL and pltR genes

In the Plt biosynthetic structural, regulatory, and transport gene cluster of P. aeruginosa M18 (Genbank accession number AY394844), the divergently transcribed pltL and pltR genes were separated by a large and complex intergenic region (652 bp) that likely contains a number of promoters and regulatory elements.
Generally, putative promoters predicted by the NNPP software (P>0.8) need further experimental confirmation through lacZ reporter fusion analysis.
The NNPP analysis showed five putative promoters in both the pltR and pltL directions.
These predicted promoter fragments were respectively amplified and fused with the promoterless lacZ gene in the plasmid pME6522 (Fig. 1A and 1C).
beta-Galactosidase activity expressed from these putative promoter - lacZ fusion plasmids were assayed in E. coli DH5alpha and P. aeruginosa M18.
As shown in Fig. 1B, among the R1 to R4 - lacZ fusion plasmids that carried five putative promoters in the pltR direction (the R3 fragment contains two putative promoters), only the R4 - lacZ fusion expressed a significantly higher beta-galactosidase activity in both DH5alpha and M18.
The R1 to R3 - lacZ fusions did not display noticeable differences in beta-galactosidase expression from the empty plasmid pME6522 as the control.
The result indicates that the R4 fragment, spanning from-116 bp to +10 bp relative to the putative TSS (transcriptional start site, +1) of pltR, harbors an actual pltR promoter that also shows a certain level of basal expression activity in E. coli DH5alpha.

Similarly, five predicted promoter fragments (L1 to L5) in the pltL direction were respectively fused with the lacZ gene of pME6522 (Fig. 1C).
Two of the predicted promoters extended into the pltL ORF.
In the M18 strain, all five putative promoters did not show any significant expression compared with the pME6522 control (Fig. 1D).
However, the L1 - lacZ fusion showed a relatively higher expression (approximately 160 Miller units) in E. coli DH5alpha, but was almost entirely inhibited in P. aeruginosa M18.
This occurrence is probably due to the presence of negative specific repressors in M18.
The 164 bp L1 fragment was partially overlapped with the pltR promoter (R4) and showed similar levels of promoter activity, implying that this region likely contains a bidirectional promoter.

With the highest score of 0.94 in the NNPP promoter prediction, the putative promoter contained in the L3 fragment was supposed to be the most probable pltL promoter.
However, no promoter activity was detected in the L3 fragment by the above lacZ fusion analysis (Fig. 1D).
For this, four fragments that continuously extended from the right side of L3, namely, L3 - 1 to L3 - 4, were respectively cloned into the plasmid pME6522 to construct the corresponding lacZ fusion reporter plasmids (Fig. 1E).
The results of the beta-galactosidase assay in the M18 strain showed that the L3 - 2 - lacZ fusion displayed stronger expression (approximately 900 Miller units) in the presence of the fragment ranging from +66 bp to +124 bp relative to the putative +1 site (Fig. 1F), implying that this 59 bp fragment likely contains strong promoters or additional activating cis-regulatory motifs.
In addition, the L3 - 2 - lacZ fusion also expressed approximately 70 Miller units of beta-galactosidase activity in E. coli DH5alpha.
The L3 - 3 - lacZ fusion carrying an additional extended sequence showed similar expression levels of beta-galactosidase as the L3 - 2 - lacZ fusion in the M18 strain.
However, L3 - 3 - lacZ fusion expression was inhibited to the level of the control plasmid in DH5alpha (Fig. 1E).
These results suggest that the promoter activity expressed by the fragment ranging from +66 bp to +124 bp is probably independent of the transcriptional activator PltR and inhibited by the presence of one inhibitory motif within the region from +124 to +205 bp (relative to the putative +1).
Therefore, the search for the PltR-activated pltLp in the +124 to +205 bp region was continued.

Based on the L3 - 1 to L3 - 4 - lacZ fusion analysis results (Fig. 1E), the 235 bp L6 fragment (+19 bp to +253 bp) (Fig. 1G), which was not predicted by NNPP (even above a minimum promoter score of 0.6) to carry any promoters, could be speculated to actually harbor strong promoters.
As expected, the L6 - lacZ fusion showed stronger expression activity in the M18 strain (Fig. 1H).
In addition, the expression of L6 - lacZ fusion was almost entirely inhibited in the pltR mutant M18pltR (Fig. 1H), suggesting that one promoter contained in the L6 fragment is dependent on PltR.
To narrow down the key promoter region, three lacZ fusion plasmids, which respectively contains three truncated fragments L6 - 1, L6 - 2 and L6 - 3, were constructed (Fig. 1G).
These three lacZ fusions all expressed relatively higher levels of beta-galactosidase activity in E. coli DH5alpha, P. aeruginosa M18, and M18pltR (Fig. 1H).
Therefore, the L6 - 3 fragment ranging from +66 to +124 bp contains an intact PltR-independent promoter that may be a non-pltLp promoter.

Based on the differential expression between the L6 - lacZ and L6 - 1 - lacZ fusions in both E. coli DH5alpha and P. aeruginosa M18pltR (Fig. 1H), as well as the differential expression between the L3 - 2 - lacZ and the L3 - 3 - lacZ fusions in DH5alpha (Fig. 1F), the fragment from +124 bp to +205 bp contains a potential promoter activated by PltR.
Another set of lacZ fusion plasmids, which contains four continually prolonged fragments L6-3-1 to L6-3-4 based on L6 - 3, were constructed and assayed for beta-galactosidase expression in strains DH5alpha, M18, and M18pltR (Figs. 1F and 1H).
Interestingly, the relatively higher level of L6 - 3 - lacZ fusion expression was almost entirely inhibited by a short sequence prolongation (+124 bp to +143 bp) in all three strains.
This inhibited expression in the L6-3-1 to L6-3-3 - lacZ fusion was reversed to the greatest extent only in M18 when the L6-3-4 fragment extended to +205 (i.e., L6-3-4) (Fig. 1H).
In addition, the L6 - 4 - lacZ fusion expression was almost entirely abolished in both DH5alpha and M18pltR (Fig. 1H).
These results strongly suggest that the pltLp activated by PltR is located from +124 to +205 bp.
Moreover, this region was also shown to carry an inhibitory cis-element (+124 bp to +143 bp) for the upstream promoter contained in the L6 - 3 fragment covering from +66 bp to +124 bp relative to the putative pltL +1 site.



Mapping the TSSs of pltL and pltR

To better define the promoter region and cis-elements responsible for the regulation of plt operon expression, the TSS (+1) of the pltL and pltR genes were mapped using 5'RACE (5'Rapid amplification of cDNA end).
The results are shown in Fig. 2.
The actual +1 site of pltR, which is identical to the putative +1 site, was located at 63 bp upstream from the pltR translational start codon ATG (Fig. 2).
The actual pltR promoter identified by 5'RACE was basically consistent with the putative pltR promoter (predicted by NNPP) contained in the R4 fragment (Fig. 1A).

Relative to pltR, the composition of the promoters and regulatory elements in the pltL direction were more complex and diverse.
The 5'RACE result shows that the pltL TSS is located 46 bp upstream from the pltL ATG site (Fig. 2).
The L6 fragment (Fig. 1G), which was not predicted by NNPP to carry any promoter, actually contains two promoters, namely, the pltLp activated by PltR and its neighboring upstream promoter (Px).
The putative -10 and -35 regions in these promoters differ substantially from each other and are also markedly different from the canonical -10 (TTGACA) and -35 (TATAAT) sequences.
As positively activated genes or operons generally have poor -35 and/or -10 regions their transcription mostly relies on the assistance of an activator protein to stabilize promoter-RNAP interaction.
The fact that PltR regulates the pltL promoter but not the Px promoter is consistent with the low level of conservation between the -10 and -35 regions of the two promoters.
The Px promoter was located at the -143 bp to -86 bp relative to the pltL TSS (Fig. 2), which corresponds to the L6 - 3 fragment (Fig. 1G).
However, several attempts to experimentally identify the TSS of the Px promoter failed.
Remarkably, a perfect palindromic motif composed of two 9 bp reverse complementary sequences separated by 4 bp was sandwiched exactly between the pltL and Px promoters (Fig. 2).
The preceding results show that the presence of half of this palindromic motif could abolish the expression of the Px promoter (Figs. 1G and 1H, L6-3-1).
Furthermore, the 22-bp interrupted palindromic motif perfectly matched the conservative LTTR binding site (T-N11-A) [19].
Therefore, this motif, designated as the lys box hereafter, was supposed to function as the target site of the LTTR protein PltR, which was verified by the following experiments.



The pltLp promoter region (-84 bp to +1) was directly bound and activated by PltR

Among the two neighboring promoters (pltLp and Px) in the pltL direction, Px was not controlled by PltR (Figs. 1G and 1F).
The next focus was on characterizing the PltR-activated pltLp.
To confirm the activation function of PltR on the experimentally positioned pltLp, the pltLp - lacZ transcriptional fusion plasmid (p6522 - pltLp) containing the pltLp and its upstream palindromic lys box (-84 bp to +1), was constructed and transformed into E. coli DH5alpha, P. aeruginosa M18, the pltR mutant M18pltR and its complementary strain M18pltR/pBBR - pltR.
The beta-galactosidase activity was measured in KMB to compare pltLp - lacZ fusion expression between the presence and absence of pltR.
As shown in Fig. 3A, the expression of the pltLp - lacZ fusion was completely inhibited in M18pltR when compared with that (approximately 200 Miller units) in the wild-type strain M18.
With the introduction of the pltR overexpression plasmid pBBR - pltR, the pltLp - lacZ expression in the pltR mutant was restored and even significantly increased, compared with that in the M18 strain.
The result clearly demonstrates that the 85 bp promoter region comprising its neighboring lys box needed to be activated by PltR (Fig. 3A).
In addition, no evident expression in the pltLp - lacZ fusion was detected in E. coli DH5alpha (Fig. 3A).
The pltLp - lacZ expression was not restored in the DH5alpha strain harboring the double plasmids, pBBR - pltR, and p6522 - pltLp (data not shown), indicating that the pltLp expression requires the participation of other activation factors aside from the indispensable activator PltR.

EMSA was further designed to detect whether PltR directly binds to the pltLp region.
The pltLp fragment (-84 bp to +1) was chosen to assess its binding affinity with PltR.
As presented in Fig. 3B (Lanes 1 to 13), when 0.5 nM biotin-labeled pltLp fragments were incubated with increasing amounts of PltR protein (0 to 70 muM) in a 10 mul reaction system, the PltR protein showed specific binding activity with pltLp.
Accompanied by the increasing concentration of PltR, the lagged bands representing the PltR-pltLp complex gradually strengthened while the biotin-labled free DNA probes significantly declined and was almost entirely bound by 20 muM PltR.
The Hfq protein, as negative control, showed no binding activity with pltLp.
A 1000-fold molar excess of unlabeled pltLp probes entirely displaced the biotin-labeled probes from PltR.
Based on these data, it can be concluded that PltR directly binds the pltLp, thereby activating plt operon expression.
This observation deserves further investigation to define the key sequence responsible for the binding of PltR to pltLp.



The 22 bp palindromic lys box is indispensable to the binding and activation of the pltLp by PltR

A putative secondary structure folded from pltLp and its upstream palindromic box (-84 bp to +1) by Mfold 3.2 is shown in Fig. 4A.
The 22 bp lys box (-74 bp to -53 bp) constituting a typical T-N11-A LTTR binding site was supposed to form into a stem loop structure for binding and activation by PltR.
Another two stem loops located from -47 bp to -4 bp were assumed as the cis-elements (-10 and -35 sequences) for RNA polymerase.
Two pltLp - lacZ derivative plasmids, p6522 - pltLp-2 and p6522 - pltLp-3, which respectively carry a deletion of half or the entire lys box, were constructed to assess the effect of the lys box on pltLp activity (Fig. 4B).
As shown in Fig. 4C, half and entire deletion of the lys box induced complete inhibition of the pltLp - lacZ fusion expression to approximately the expression level of the empty plasmid pME6522.
Without the presence of the complete lys box, the pltLp could not be initiated.
This confirms that the lys box is indispensable for the initiation and activation of the pltLp.

Correspondingly, the biotin-labeled pltLp, pltLp-2, and pltLp-3 DNA probes (0.5 nM) were respectively utilized to carry out the EMSA analysis with increasing PltR concentrations (0 to 60 muM).
The results are shown in Fig. 4D.
The PltR protein displayed stronger binding affinity with the pltLp fragment with the intact lys box.
As expected, half or whole deletion of the lys box completely abolished the binding of pltLp with PltR.
No evident binding complexes were observed in the EMSA between the biotin-labeled pltLp-2 or pltLp-3 probe and the PltR protein (Fig. 4D, Lanes 4 to 9 and Lanes 10 to 15).
The results suggest that PltR directly binds to the pltLp region at the indispensable and intact palindromic lys box and thus activate the pltLp expression.



Effects of point mutations in the lys box on the expression and PltR binding of pltLp

To determine the effects of the lys box mutations on plt operon expression and PltR - pltLp binding, four pltLp derivative fragments carrying a serial of point mutations in the lys box were amplified and used to construct lacZ fusion plasmids and carry out an EMSA analysis.
To open the putative stem-loop structure formed by the lys box (Fig. 4A), 2 bp (M2), 4 bp (M4), and 6 bp (M6) substitutions were designed in one of two 9 bp reversely complementary sequences in the lys box (Fig. 5A).
The other 4 bp replacement was introduced to the M4 mutant to be complementary to the originally replaced 4 bp, producing the M4-M pltLp mutant, which could regenerate a 22 bp stem-loop structure with different base arrangements from the wild-type pltLp.
The beta-galactosidase activity expressed from the pltLp - lacZ fusion wild-type plasmid (p6522 - pltLp) and its four derived mutant plasmids were assayed in P. aeruginosa M18.
As depicted in Fig. 5B, the pltLp - lacZ fusion expression was significantly reduced, even entirely abolished, by the four lys-box mutants (Fig. 5B).
The beta-galactosidase expression of pltLp - lacZ, pltLp-M2 - lacZ, pltLp-M4 - lacZ, to pltLp-M6 - lacZ fusion, showed a gradual and significant decreasing trend with the gradual opening of the stem-loop structure, which suggests that the secondary structure of the lys box plays a key role in the binding and activation of the pltLp by PltR.
In addition, the inhibited beta-galactosidase expression from the pltLp-M4 - lacZ fusion was not restored; it continued to decrease to the expression level of the empty plasmid pME6522 by a complementary 4 bp substitution carried by the M4-M mutant.
This finding implies that the sequence specificity of the lys box is also essential for the binding and activation of the pltLp by PltR.

Biotin-labeled DNA probes corresponding to the wild-type and mutagenized fragments of pltLp were subjected to an EMSA to assess the influence of point mutations in the lys box on the PltR - pltLp binding interaction.
Subsequently, 0.5 nM biotin-labeled DNA probes were co-incubated with 0, 10, and 60 muM PltR.
As shown in Fig. 5C, a 2 bp (or 4 bp, 6 bp) substitution and an 8 bp complementary substitution in the lys box resulted in significant decrease in the pltLp binding activity by PltR.
The decrease was clearly reflected by an enormous reduction in the intensity of the retarded PltR - pltLp-M2 (or M4, M6, M4-M) complex bands, compared with those of the PltR - pltLp - wt complex bands.
With the number of substituted bases increasing from 2 bp to 6 bp, the stem-loop structure formed by the lys box was opened step by step and thus the binding between the DNA probes and PltR gradually declined.
Although the stem-loop structure was reshaped by a 4 bp complementary substitution in pltLp - M4-M, its binding with PltR was not restored to levels exceeding that of pltLp-M4 with PltR.
This experiment confirms that the secondary structure and the primary sequence of the lys box are crucial for the PltR-activated expression of the plt operon.



Plt specifically induce the pltL promoter and thus enhance the plt operon expression

The autoinduction phenomenon, wherein Plt enhance the expression of its own biosynthetic operon pltLABCDEFG, has been reported in P. fluorescens Pf-5 [18] and P. aeruginosa M18 [4].
To assess whether the pltLp is specifically induced by Plt, two lacZ fusion plasmids, p6522 - pltLp and p6522 - L6-1, which respectively carry the pltLp and its upstream Px promoter, were transformed into M18pltB mutant not producing Plt.
beta-Galactosidase activity was assayed in KMB media amended without or with 10 microg ml-1 exogenous Plt.
As depicted in Figs. 6A and 6B, the pltLp - lacZ fusion expression was significantly enhanced by the addition of exogenous Plt, whereas the Px - lacZ fusion expression did not reveal any noticeable difference between the KMB with and without 10 microg ml-1 exogenous Plt.
The data clearly suggests that the PltR-activated pltLp was specifically induced by the secondary metabolite Plt.
Moreover, the qRT-PCR result also shows that the transcript accumulation of pltA, which is the second gene in the pltLABCDEFG biosynthetic structural operon, in the M18pltB strain was strongly increased in KMB with 10 microg ml-1 exogenous Plt compared with that in KMB without the addition of Plt (Fig. 6C).
