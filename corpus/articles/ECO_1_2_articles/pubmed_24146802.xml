      <abstract>
        <p>Transcriptional negative regulation of the proteolytic system of <italic>Lactobacillus helveticus</italic> CM4 in response to amino acids seems to be very important for the control of antihypertensive peptide production; however, it remains poorly understood. A 26-kDa protein with N-terminal cystathionine &#x3B2;-synthase domains (CBS domain protein), which seems to be involved in the regulatory system, was purified by using a DNA-sepharose bound 300-bp DNA fragment corresponding to the upstream regions of the six proteolytic genes that are down-regulated by amino acids. The CBS domain protein bound to a DNA fragment corresponding to the region upstream of the <italic>pepV</italic> gene in response to branched chain amino acids (BCAAs). The expression of the <italic>pepV</italic> gene in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> grown in BCAA-enriched medium was repressed when the CBS domain protein was co-expressed. These results reveal that the CBS domain protein acts as a novel type of BCAA-responsive transcriptional regulator (BCARR) in <italic>L. helveticus</italic>. From comparative analysis of the promoter regions of the six proteolysis genes, a palindromic AT-rich motif, 5&#x2032;-AAAAANNCTWTTATT-3&#x2032;, was predicted as the consensus DNA motif for the BCARR protein binding. Footprint analysis using the <italic>pepV</italic> promotor region and gel shift analyses with the corresponding short DNA fragments strongly suggested that the BCARR protein binds adjacent to the <italic>pepV</italic> promoter region and affects the transcription level of the <italic>pepV</italic> gene in the presence of BCAAs. Homology search analysis of the C-terminal region of the BCARR protein suggested the existence of a unique &#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B2;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B2; fold structure that has been reported in a variety of ACT (aspartate kinase-chorismate mutase-tyrA) domain proteins for sensing amino acids. These results also suggest that the sensing of BCAAs by the ACT domain might promote the binding of the BCARR to DNA sequences upstream of proteolysis genes, which affects the gene expression of the proteolytic system in <italic>L. helveticus.</italic></p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Among <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> species, <italic>Lactobacillus helveticus</italic> is widely used as a starter culture in the manufacture of a variety of fermented dairy products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Slattery1">[1]</xref>, such as yogurt and Swiss cheese <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Gatti1">[2]</xref>. <italic>L. helveticus</italic> is a Gram-positive, nonspore-forming microaerophilic rod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Sneath1">[3]</xref> that can grow rapidly in milk because of its high proteolytic activity, which allows it to utilize peptides and amino acids released from the hydrolysis of milk proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-SadatMekmene1">[4]</xref>. The use of <italic>L. helveticus</italic> in the production of dairy products has received increased attention because of the organism&#x2019;s ability to generate antihypertensive peptides from casein during the milk fermentation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Yamamoto1">[5]</xref>. The antihypertensive effect was shown to be specific to <italic>L. helveticus</italic> fermented milk in a study using spontaneously hypertensive rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Yamamoto1">[5]</xref>. Key active components of the antihypertensive effect of <italic>L. helveticus</italic> fermented milk are considered to be Val-Pro-Pro (VPP) and Ile-Pro-Pro (IPP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Nakamura1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Nakamura2">[7]</xref>, which inhibit angiotensin I-converting enzyme (kininase II; EC 3.4.15.1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Ondetti1">[8]</xref>. A highly active cell wall-associated proteinase and several intracellular peptidases specific to <italic>L. helveticus</italic> strain CM4 are thought to be responsible for the organism&#x2019;s ability to release large amounts of these two antihypertensive tripeptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Yamamoto2">[9]</xref>. However, the production of VPP and IPP by <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 is mildly repressed by peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Yamamoto3">[10]</xref> and amino acids that accumulate in fermented milk as a result of the down-regulation of genes such as <italic>pepO2</italic>, <italic>pepCE</italic> and <italic>pepE</italic>, which most likely encode enzymes involved in the processing of both bioactive peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Wakai1">[11]</xref>. In <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic>, most of the genes regulated by the CodY protein in response to branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are involved in the proteolysis system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Gudon1">[12]</xref>. In <italic>L. lactis</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, BCAAs modulate the activity of CodY by increasing the affinity of CodY for its operator sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Belitsky1">[13]</xref>&#x2013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Petranovic1">[15]</xref>. In <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, an additional level of regulation of CodY activity is provided by GTP, an indicator of the energy state of the cell, which stimulates CodY activity independent of BCAAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Blagova1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-RatnayakeLecamwasam1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In the previous study, the existence of a CodY-like regulatory system controlling expression of the <italic>pepO</italic>, <italic>pepO2</italic>, <italic>pepV</italic>, <italic>pepCE</italic>, <italic>pepT2</italic> and <italic>dppD</italic> genes in response to amino acids was suggested by transcriptome analysis of <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Wakai1">[11]</xref>. However, there are no CodY-like homologs in lactobacilli and no reports of a regulator in lactobacilli to explain the repressive effect on the proteolytic system by amino acids. We predicted that <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 has a novel regulatory protein with affinity for DNA sequences located upstream of these proteolysis genes, and therefore we attempted to purify a regulatory protein with a DNA-affinity resin to identify the regulatory protein. Here we report the characterization and structural features of a novel regulatory protein from <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4, and demonstrate its ability to bind to a specific DNA-motif located upstream of genes encoding proteolytic enzymes to control their expression.</p>

        <title>Preparation of DNA-sepharose</title>
        <p>Six pairs of primers were designed to amplify the promoter regions (approximately 300 bp each) controlling expression of 6 proteolysis genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075976-t001">Table 1</xref>) known to be down-regulated in the presence of peptides in <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Wakai1">[11]</xref>.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 10 min, and washed with 10 ml of 0.01 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1 M NaCl, 25% (W/V) sucrose. Then 5 ml of 0.3 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 0.1 M EDTA containing 4 mg/ml lysozyme and 1 mg/ml muramidase was added and the sample was incubated at 30&#xB0;C for 60 min. Cells were disrupted by adding 25 ml of 1.0 M NaCl, 0.02 M EDTA, 0.08% deoxycholate, pH 7.0. After incubating on ice for 10 min, the suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. The supernatant was mixed with 70 ml of 17% (W/V) polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG), and 0.157 M NaCl containing 2% casamino acids to precipitate the chromosomal DNA for the collection of DNA-associated proteins. The mixture was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm and the precipitated DNA-protein complex was collected and suspended in 10 ml of 5% PEG, 2 M NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9 to release DNA binding proteins from the precipitated chromosomal DNA. DNA binding proteins were isolated in the supernatant after centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. After dialysis against 1 L of TE buffer, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mM EDTA, at 4&#xB0;C for 20 h, the sample was loaded onto a 2 ml DNA-sepharose column in the presence of 10 mM each of BCAAs (Val, Ile, Leu). The column was washed with five column volumes of 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 10% glycerol (Hepes buffer) containing 10 mM of each BCAA. Proteins of interest were expected to lose affinity for DNA in the absence of BCAAs, and were eluted by washing the column with 5 bed volumes of Hepes buffer without BCAAs. Protein purity was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) according to the method of Laemmli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Laemmli1">[19]</xref> using a 5&#x2013;15% linear gradient polyacrylamide gel.

        <p>DNase I footprinting analysis using purified BCARR protein was performed according to the method described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Grant1">[23]</xref>. After the PCR amplification of a 309 bp DNA fragment from upstream of the <italic>pepV</italic> gene using 5&#x2032;-OH primers, the DNA fragment was labelled with [&#x3B3;<sup>&#x2212;32</sup>P]-ATP by using T4 DNA kinase. Then, the radioisotope-labeled DNA fragments were cut with <italic>Alu</italic>I to generate a DNA fragment labeled with <sup>32</sup>P at one end (&#x2212;266 to +24). Binding reactions were carried out in 10 &#xB5;l of reaction mixture containing 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, about 3 ng of <sup>32</sup>P labeled PCR fragment (about 100,000 cpm), and 0.01% bovine serum albumin with 0, 2.3 and 18 &#xB5;M BCARR protein. After incubation at 30&#xB0;C for 10 min, protein-DNA complexes were treated with 0.125 units of DNase I for 1.5 min at 37&#xB0;C. After heating at 90&#xB0;C for 1 min, the DNase I treated samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 M urea in TBE buffer, and <sup>32</sup>P signals were detected by exposure to X-ray film (Fuji Film). An A+G sequence ladder was prepared by the method of Maxam and Gilbert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Liu1">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Purification and Identification of DNA Binding Proteins</title>
        <p>To collect DNA binding proteins, intracellular components with affinity to <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 genomic DNA were co-precipitated with chromosomal DNA by adding polyethylene glycol 6000 as described in Materials and Methods. The precipitated proteins released from DNA by adding 1 M NaCl were then applied to an affinity column in the presence of BCAAs. The affinity column contained DNA-sepharose bound PCR fragments corresponding to the DNA upstream of the <italic>pepV, pepO, pepO2, pepT2, pepCE</italic> and <italic>dppD</italic> genes. Proteins with molecular masses of 24, 26 and 67 kDa were specifically released from the affinity resin by washing with BCAA-free Hepes buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The three proteins were identified by sequence analyses of peptides released from each protein band. The 67 kDa protein was identified as a prolyl-tRNA synthase, which would not be expected to bind to DNA. In contrast, the 26 kDa and 24 kDa proteins were identified as same protein with homology to the 26.3 kDa protein lhv_0288 (YP_001576806.1) of <italic>L. helveticus</italic> DPC 4571 (NC_010080.1). This result indicated that the 24 kDa protein might be a degradation product of the 26 kDa protein. The 26 kDa protein has two tandem cystathionine &#x3B2;-synthase domains (CBS pair) at the amino terminus as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Ignoul1">[26]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). CBS catalyzes the formation of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine. CBS domains with no catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Ignoul1">[26]</xref> are widely distributed in most species of life but their functions are largely unknown. A recent study suggested that the CBS domain protein MJ0729 from <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic> might bind to the E-box of DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-AguadoLlera1">[27]</xref>. These results suggested that the 26 kDa protein with a CBS domain (CBS domain protein) might have affinity for DNA upstream of the <italic>pepV</italic>, <italic>pepO</italic>, <italic>pepO2</italic>, <italic>pepT2</italic>, <italic>pepCE</italic> and/or <italic>dppD</italic> genes in the presence of BCAAs.</p>

        <title>DNA Binding of the CBS Domain Protein</title>
        <p>To confirm the DNA binding ability of the 26 kDa CBS domain protein from strain CM4, the corresponding gene was amplified by PCR using primers 26 kF and 26 kR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0075976-t001">Table 1</xref>) to prepare a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein by the method described in Materials and Methods. The GST fusion protein was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101, and the CBS domain protein was purified by using a glutathione-sepharose affinity column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Then, electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were carried out with the purified protein and a 309 bp DNA fragment corresponding to the <italic>pepV</italic> promoter region in the presence or absence of 10 mM BCAAs. The DNA band was shifted by 3 &#xB5;M CBS domain protein in the absence or presence of BCAAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, a band shift was observed with 1.5 &#xB5;M CBS domain protein only when BCAAs were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>To understand the effect of various single amino acids on the binding of the CBS domain protein to DNA, 10 mM each of Val, Leu, Ile, Gly, His, Ser, Thr, Pro or Met was used in EMSAs with the <italic>pepV</italic> upstream probe. Each BCAA promoted CBS domain protein binding to the <italic>pepV</italic> gene, and Ile was most effective. However, no shift was observed in EMSAs with the other tested amino acids (Gly, His, Ser, Thr, Pro or Met) (data not shown). These results also suggest that Ile has the highest affinity for the ACT domain, and the BCARR-Ile complex is capable of binding to the target DNA. Unlike <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> CodY, the transcriptional regulator that senses BCAAs in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, GTP was not necessary for the CBS domain protein to bind to DNA (data not shown).</p>

        <title>Transcriptional Regulation of the CBS Domain Protein (BCARR)</title>
        <p><italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 is a non-transformable strain and therefore we were unable to isolate a mutant strain lacking the gene encoding the CBS domain protein. Therefore, to understand the influence of the CBS domain protein on the transcriptional level of the proteolysis system of <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4, the <italic>pepV</italic> gene was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101 cells with or without co-expression of the gene encoding the CBS domain protein. The <italic>pepV</italic> gene was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101 by introduction of pBR-pepV, which includes the <italic>pepV</italic> ORF and about 500 bp of upstream DNA. Then, the CBS domain protein gene was co-expressed with the <italic>pepV</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101 harboring pBR-pepV-CBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The transcription levels of the <italic>pepV</italic> gene in both strains, quantified by real-time PCR, were not changed in M9 minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g003">Figure 3</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>pepV</italic> gene transcription was decreased to 73% in <italic>E. coli</italic> harboring pBR-pepV-CBS compared to pBR-pepV, when casamino acids and BCAAs were present in the medium. These results suggest the possibility that the CBS domain protein expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> HB101 binds upstream of the <italic>pepV</italic> gene in response to BCAAs and represses transcription of the <italic>pepV</italic> gene. The CBS domain protein may be a novel type of regulatory protein involved in controlling the transcription of the proteolytic system by sensing BCAAs in <italic>L. helveticus</italic>. Therefore, the CBS domain protein was named Branched Chain Amino acids Responsive Transcriptional Regulator (BCARR), and the sequence was submitted to DDBJ (accession number: AB812553).</p>

        <p>To examine whether the BCARR protein binds the predicted DNA sequence (BCARR-box) in the <italic>pepV</italic> promoter region, DNase I footprinting analysis was performed.

        <title>Prediction of the BCAA Sensing Domain Structure in the BCARR Protein</title>
        <p>To understand the structural features of the BCARR protein, a possible domain motif for sensing amino acids at the C-terminal region of the BCARR protein was predicted (131&#x2013;235 aa) by PSI-BLAST homology searching. An ACT domain composed of four &#x3B2; strands and two &#x3B1; helices arranged as a &#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B2;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B2; fold was observed at the C-terminus of BCARR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g007">Figure 7</xref>). ACT domains, named after the first letters of three of the proteins aspartate kinase-chorismate mutase-tyrA (prephenate dehydrogenase), have been reported to have the ability to bind amino acids and function to regulate certain aspects of amino acid metabolism. Based on the alignment analysis, the glycine residue is most likely important in the binding pocket as it is well conserved in the ACT domain of BCARR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In our previous study, transcriptional down-regulation of the proteolytic system and reduced release of the antihypertensive peptides VPP and IPP were observed in <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 fermented milk when peptides were added into the fermented milk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Wakai1">[11]</xref>. In the present study, we successfully identified a 26 kDa CBS domain protein by affinity purification with DNA from regions upstream of proteolysis genes that were repressed in response to peptides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Wakai1">[11]</xref>. The repression of <italic>pepV</italic> gene expression in the <italic>E. coli</italic> transformant expressing the CBS domain protein gene compared to the control strain without the CBS domain protein gene was not large (73%), but was similar to the repression by 2% peptides in <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Wakai1">[11]</xref>. Here we named this novel 26 kDa CBS domain protein, which functions to down-regulate proteolysis gene expression in response to BCAAs in <italic>L. helveticus</italic>, BCARR (Branched Chain Amino acids Responsive Transcriptional Regulator). This protein may function as a negative transcriptional regulator for the proteolytic system that allows cells to conserve energy when sufficient amino acids are present. <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> elements of the CodY regulon, which regulate proteolysis genes in response to intracellular amino acids, have been reported in <italic>L. lactis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-denHengst1">[14]</xref>, <italic>B. subtilis</italic>

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Ritt1">[33]</xref>, but not in lactobacilli. Phylogenetic analysis of the <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 BCARR protein revealed the existence of homologs in lactobacillaceae, enterococcaceae, leuconostocaceae, carnobacteriaceae, listeriaceae, exiguobacteria and bacillaceae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Among them, enterococcaceae, listeriaceae and bacillaceae (one species; <italic>Bacillus selenitireducens</italic>) have homologs of both CodY and BCARR based on BLASTP searches (cutoff e-value &gt;10<sup>&#x2212;50</sup>) as described in Materials and Methods. On the other hand, no BCARR homologs were present in the streptococcaceae, including lactococci, and bacillaceae, which have a CodY homolog that regulates the proteolysis system. The roles of the two types of transcriptional regulators in the enterococcaceae, listeriaceae and bacillaceae (one species; <italic>Bacillus selenitireducens</italic>) are still not clear. To understand the role of each protein, isolation and characterization of knock-out strains will be needed.</p>
      <p>Cystathionine &#x3B2;-synthase (CBS) catalyzes the formation of cystathionine from homocysteine and serine. CBS has been conserved in eukaryotic evolution and is involved in the removal of homocysteine from the methionine cycle. In humans, a CBS deficiency results in an elevated level of circulating homocysteine (homocystinuria), which is a risk factor for a number of neurological defects and vascular diseases. However, the presence of a CBS domain motif with no catalytic domain has been reported in various proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Ignoul1">[26]</xref> as observed at the N-terminal region of BCARR in the present study. CBS domains are widely distributed in most species of life but their functions are largely unknown. Although their functions are unknown, a previous study suggested that an archaeal CBS domain protein binds to DNA in <italic>Methanocaldococcus jannaschii</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-AguadoLlera1">[27]</xref>. Relatively little is known about the role of CBS domain proteins as transcriptional regulators in bacteria and until now there have been no reports of CBS proteins binding to specific regulatory sequences in response to BCAAs. Interestingly, an ACT domain containing a &#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B2;&#x3B2;&#x3B1;&#x3B2;-motif, which is thought to be a common regulatory structure in amino acid metabolic enzymes and transcriptional regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Grant1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Yin1">[34]</xref>, was predicted at the C-terminal region of the BCARR from 135 aa to 210 aa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The majority of proteins containing ACT domains appear to interact with amino acids and be involved in some aspect of regulation of amino acid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Chipman1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Ettema1">[36]</xref>. The presented results suggest that BCAAs bind to the ACT domain at the C-terminus of the BCARR protein and the complex increases the affinity of the CBS domain binding to a DNA sequence motif upstream of proteolysis genes (BCARR-box) as shown by the footprint analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g006">Figure 6</xref>), thereby preventing RNA polymerase from binding to the promoters and repressing the transcription of the downstream genes. The reported results also support the down-regulation of other proteolysis genes listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g004">Figure 4</xref>, each with an upstream BCARR-box. The positions of the BCARR boxes upstream of the <italic>pepO</italic> and <italic>pepCE</italic> genes were relatively far from the ORFs; however, the wide area of DNA protection by BCARR could repress the transcription of these genes.</p>
      <p>The search for a common DNA motif in the promoter regions of the six genes resulted in the identification of a unique AT-rich sequence containing a palindromic DNA sequence, 5&#x2032;-AAAAANNCTWTTATT- 3&#x2032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The consensus motif was observed upstream of other <italic>L. helveticus</italic> genes that are down-regulated in response to added peptides, as observed in the previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Wakai1">[11]</xref>, such as the <italic>hisM</italic> operon, the <italic>potE</italic> gene, the <italic>lysA</italic> operon, and the <italic>serC</italic> operon. Furthermore, EMSAs for various DNA fragments corresponding to the region upstream of the <italic>pepV</italic> gene revealed that the predicted consensus motif of the <italic>pepV</italic> gene (BCARR-box) from &#x2212;91 to &#x2212;77 bp from the start codon was contained in the sequence (&#x2212;116 to &#x2212;76) that bound with the highest affinity to the BCARR protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Footprint analysis also demonstrated binding of the BCARR protein to the <italic>pepV</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, there was no similarity of the predicted BCARR protein binding DNA motif to the codY-box DNA motif (5&#x2032;-AATTTTCWGAAAATT-3&#x2032;) reported in <italic>L. lactis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-denHengst1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, no highly conserved CodY helix-turn-helix (HTH) motif (AS++AD++GITRSVIVNALR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Joseph1">[37]</xref> was found in the BCARR protein. With respect to the similarity between the BCARR protein of <italic>L. helveticus</italic> CM4 and CodY in <italic>L. lactis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-denHengst1">[14]</xref>, the most significant band shifts depended on Ile and BCAAs levels, and the BCAA level needed for effective EMSA band shifts (2.5 mM for the BCARR protein and 5 mM for CodY <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-denHengst2">[38]</xref>). Moreover, neither protein needs GTP, which is an indicator of the energy state of the cells. A different but AT-rich sequence was also required for DNA binding of both the BCARR protein in <italic>L. helveticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and CodY in <italic>L. lactis</italic>
<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-denHengst2">[38]</xref> when BCAAs were present in EMSA analyses. These similarities in BCAA sensing and binding to AT-rich DNA upstream of proteolysis genes by the nonhomologous BCARR and CodY proteins are particularly interesting.</p>
      <p>The wide and higher band shift observed in response to BCAAs in EMSAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g004">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g005">5A</xref>) suggests the possibility of oligomerization of the BCARR protein in the DNA-protein complex. Oligomerization of proteins containing CBS domains was suggested in a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Baykov1">[39]</xref>. The oligomerization of the BCARR protein may be triggered after the formation of the BCARR-DNA complex because higher band shifts were observed when a short DNA fragment containing the BCARR-box was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and large BCARR-DNA complex formed when a large amount of the BCARR protein was used in DNA footprint analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g006">Figure 6</xref>).</p>
      <p>A mechanism for the repression of VPP and IPP release in CM4 fermented milk is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0075976-g009">Figure 9</xref>. Long peptides containing VPP and IPP sequences released by an extracellular proteinase (I) from milk casein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Wakai2">[40]</xref> enter the cell via an oligopeptide transporter (II). The long peptides are then processed by intracellular peptidases, including the endopeptidases PepO and PepO2, and tripeptidase, PepT2, and the aminopeptidase, PepCE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0075976-Wakai1">[11]</xref>. BCAAs released from intracellular peptides may be associated with BCARR at the ACT domain (III) and the complex may increase the affinity for promoter regions of these proteolysis genes via the CBS domain region (IV), which represses expression of the proteolysis genes (V) and lowers the levels of VPP and IPP released (VI) in <italic>L. helveticus</italic>. This model also suggests that there would be an increased amount of bioactive peptides in a mutant strain lacking the BCARR protein.</p>
