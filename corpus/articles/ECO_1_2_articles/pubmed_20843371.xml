          <title>Background</title>
          <p>The two-component systems of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis </italic>are apparently required for its growth and resistance in hostile host environments. In such environments, MtrAB has been reported to regulate the expression of the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>replication initiator gene, <italic>dnaA</italic>. However, the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter binding sites and many potential target genes for MtrA have yet to be precisely characterized.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Results</title>
          <p>In this study, a 7 bp sequence motif in the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter region was identified for MtrA binding using DNaseI footprinting assays and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Approximately 420 target genes potentially regulated by MtrA, including the isoniazid inducible gene <italic>iniB</italic>, were further characterized from <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>genomes. When assayed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), many of the target genes demonstrated significant expression changes when the antisense mRNA of the <italic>mtrA </italic>gene was expressed in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. The recombinant mycobacteria grew in length and were more sensitive to two anti-tuberculosis drugs, isoniazid and streptomycin.</p>

      <title>Background</title>
      <p><italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>is one of the most devastating human pathogens, and its threat to human health has intensified with the emergence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and the worldwide prevalence of co-infection with HIV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Two-component regulatory systems (TCRs) are widely distributed among bacteria and plants and enable organisms to regulate gene expression in response to a variety of environmental stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Some TCRs are clearly involved in regulating the virulence of pathogenic bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>The <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>genome contains 11 paired TCRs and several orphan kinases and regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Several TCRs are apparently required for the growth of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>under specific conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]; for example, <italic>mprA-mprB </italic>is important for the maintenance of persistence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Of the 11 <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>TCRs, only the <italic>mtrA-mtrB </italic>system has been confirmed as essential for <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>survival of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Several recent reports show that the regulator MtrA modulates <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>proliferation by regulating <italic>dnaA </italic>expression and binding the origin of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In <italic>Mycobacterium avium</italic>, morphotypic multidrug resistance requires the presence of an MtrA homologue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>The <italic>mtrAB </italic>system has been successfully deleted in <italic>Corynebacterium glutamicum</italic>, an industrial amino acid production strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Mutant cells lacking <italic>mtrAB </italic>showed a different cell morphology and were more sensitive to penicillin, vancomycin, and lysozyme, however, they were more resistant to ethambutol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The expression of some genes involved in both peptidoglycan metabolism and osmoprotection was also substantially changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, MtrAB in <italic>C. glutamicum </italic>is thought to be involved in regulating cell wall metabolism and osmoprotection.</p>
      <p>The <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>MtrAB system is thought to be involved in the expression of many target genes and contributes to the pathogen survival and resistance within its host tissue. However, these target genes and their MtrA binding sites have not been clearly established. In the current study, we have identified conserved sites for the recognition of MtrA in the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter, as well as approximately 420 potential target genes. Further <italic>in vivo </italic>studies concerning a related organism, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, reveal changes in both cell morphology and drug resistance when MtrA gene expression is inhibited. The data presented here significantly enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of the essential two-component MtrAB system and its role in mycobacterial drug resistance.</p>

        <title>MtrA interacted with the regulatory region of the <italic>M. tuberculosis dnaA </italic>gene</title>
        <p>Bacterial one-hybrid assays confirmed the interaction between MtrA and the regulatory sequence of the <italic>dnaA </italic>initiator gene. The <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter region was cloned into the reporter genes upstream of <italic>HIS3-aadA </italic>and the reporter vector pBXcmT (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, the co-transformant strain with the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter and MtrA was observed to grow well on the screening medium. In contrast, there was no growth for the strain containing either MtrA or the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter alone. In addition, neither the co-transformant strain containing an unrelated DNA, SsoDNA (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), nor MtrA did grew, indicating that this DNA cannot interact with MtrA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Thus, MtrA specifically interacted with the <italic>dnaA </italic>gene promoter.</p>

        <p>The interaction of the purified MtrA protein with the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter was confirmed by the interaction with the DNA on the chip. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, the biotinylated promoter DNA was first associated with the streptavidin (SA) chip (GE Healthcare). When an increasing concentration of MtrA protein (100-500 nM) was passed over the chip surface, a corresponding increasing response value was observed. This again indicated that the MtrA protein could bind with the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In contrast, heated inactive protein showed no response when it was passed over the chip (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). When an unspecific DNA, the promoter of Rv0467, was coated on the chip, no significant association for MtrA was observed (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). In a further confirmatory experiment, 200 &#x3BC;M unlabeled promoter DNA was also added along with the MtrA protein. This DNA competed with that on the chip for the available MtrA; here, a significantly lower response was observed compared to a control with no competition (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Characterization of the DNA-box motif in the dnaA promoter that allows MtrA binding</title>
        <p>Several short DNA fragments (S1-S5) were used to precisely determine the DNA-box motif for the MtrA in this promoter region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, a specific protein/DNA complex was observed on S1, S2, and S5, indicating that MtrA could recognize these DNA substrates. In contrast, no binding activity was observed for substrates S3 and S4, both of which lacked the 5-CACGCCG-3 or 5-CACGAGG-3 sequence box (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Further confirmation of the specific interaction was obtained by conducting the competing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assay with the unlabeled DNA fragments. As shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>, a significantly lower response was observed when either the unlabeled S2 or S5 was added together with MtrA, which indicated that they could compete the binding of MtrA with the promoter DNA on the chip. Therefore, these two sequence motifs appeared to be essential for the MtrA binding with the <italic>dnaA </italic>regulatory region.</p>

        <p>The interaction between MtrA and these two sequence boxes was further confirmed by DNase I footprinting assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Regions that contain these two boxes were significantly protected when MtrA was present. Protection at S6 occurred at all MtrA concentrations while the protection of S7 was dependent on the concentration of MtrA. This suggests that MtrA has different binding affinities with these regions.</p>

        <title>Characterization of potential target genes regulated by MtrA in mycobacterial genomes</title>
        <p>We searched the intergenic regions of the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>genomes extensively based on the two sequence motifs for MtrA in the <italic>dnaA </italic>gene promoter region. To validate the target genes, several regulatory regions of the genes were amplified. The DNA-binding activities of MtrA were examined using EMSA assays. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the regulatory sequence of a predicted target gene, isoniazid inducible gene <italic>iniB </italic>(<italic>rv0341</italic>), could be recognized by MtrA. A specific DNA/protein complex band was also observed. In addition, MtrA was able to bind with two target promoter DNA sequences of Rv0574 (a hypothetical protein) and Rv3476 (KgtP), producing a corresponding DNA/protein band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The positive target DNA was shown to bind with MtrA, while the negative DNA was not. The 7 bp sequence motif could also be found in the promoter regions of two previously characterized target genes, <italic>CgmepA </italic>and <italic>CgproP</italic>, in <italic>C. glutamicum</italic>. Interestingly, <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>MtrA bound with the regulatory sequences and produced specific shifted bands (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Effects of mtrA gene expression level on mycobacterial drug resistance and cell morphology</title>
        <p>The mRNA antisense expression of the <italic>mtrA </italic>gene in <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>showed a regulatory effect of <italic>mtrA </italic>on mycobacterial drug resistance and cell morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. No substantial change was observed for the general growth of the recombinant mycobacterial strains. However, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, the recombinant mycobacterial cells became sensitive to the anti-TB drugs isoniazid and streptomycin, as evidenced by their inhibited growth in the presence of 25 &#x3BC;g/mL of isoniazid or 0.5 &#x3BC;g/mL of streptomycin in the medium. In contrast, no noticeable inhibition was observed for two other drugs, ethambutol and rifampicinB (data not shown). With a general growth of the recombinant mycobacterial strains resulting in minimal change, the cell morphology was further examined using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) technique. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, the cell lengthened when 20 ng/mL tetracycline was added to the medium to induce expression of the antisense <italic>mtrA </italic>mRNA (right panel).</p>

This was consistent with the fact that no conserved sequence motif existed within the regulatory region of this gene in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. Another approximately 26 potential target genes were randomly chosen to measure the expression change in the recombinant <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). The expression levels of these genes clearly changed; <italic>iniA </italic>and <italic>mtrB </italic>gene expression increased 2.5-fold expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), while <italic>mraZ </italic>(Msmeg_4236) and <italic>rpfB </italic>(Msmeg_5439) gene expression decreased by about 0.2-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Therefore, the inhibition of the <italic>mtrA </italic>gene resulted in corresponding expression changes in many predicted target genes in <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>. The expression level of the <italic>mtrA </italic>gene consequently affected the drug resistance and cell morphology of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>MtrAB has been reported to regulate the expression of the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>replication initiator gene, <italic>dnaA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, potential binding sites for MtrA have not been clearly characterized. In addition, there are many potential target genes that also appear to be regulated by MtrA. In the current study, we identified a 7 bp conserved sequence motif for the recognition of MtrA within the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter. About 420 potential target genes regulated by MtrAB were predicted from the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>genomes upon searching their promoter databases. Many predicted target genes showed significant expression changes when the <italic>mtrA </italic>homologue of <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>was partially inhibited. The recombinant <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>cells increased in length and became sensitive to the anti-TB drugs isoniazid and streptomycin.</p>
      <p>The transcription of <italic>dnaA </italic>starts essentially at P1<italic><sub>dnaA</sub></italic>, which is conserved in all mycobacterial species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The analysis of the sequence in the upstream region of <italic>dnaA </italic>revealed a second promoter, P2<italic><sub>dnaA, </sub></italic>in <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In previous <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments, MtrA bound with the regulatory region of the <italic>dnaA </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the current study, two binding motifs for MtrA were located immediately downstream from the two promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Therefore, MtrA can apparently interfere with the promoter activity and thus regulate the expression of the replication initiator gene. The promoter P2<italic><sub>dnaA </sub></italic>only exists in a viral strain or derivative strains such as <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, <italic>M. bovis </italic>and BCG, but not in <italic>M. avium </italic>or <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This suggests that the two-component system MtrAB might contribute to the virulence of the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>complex through selective regulation of <italic>dnaA </italic>gene expression. A parallel study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] has identified a "GTCACAgcg" motif for the recognition of MtrA in the <italic>fbpB </italic>promoter and the origin of replication. Interestingly, there exists a common conserved core sequence between the 9 bp motif and the motif identified within the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter in the current study. Using a MalE-EnvZ kinase, but not the cognate partner kinase of MtrB, Rajagopalan <italic>et al </italic>suggested that the phosphorylation of MtrA had distinct regulation capacities. However, only 5% of the MtrA protein was shown to be phosphorylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the present study, efforts to phosphorylate MtrA using the partner kinase of MtrB failed (data not shown). Importantly, using several different methods, we showed that the nonphosphorylated MtrA could bind to the target DNA very well, suggesting that the form of MtrA might be involved in regulating the expression of its target genes. Obviously, the regulation mechanism of MtrAB needs to be further addressed in the future.</p>
      <p>Attempts to disrupt the <italic>mtrA </italic>gene in <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>have been unsuccessful; thus, <italic>mtrA </italic>seems to be an essential gene for <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The genes encoding the MtrAB two-component system of <italic>C. glutamicum </italic>were deleted successfully, and this deletion strongly influenced the cell morphology, antibiotic susceptibility, and expression of genes involved in osmoprotection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In the current study, a large group of target genes for MtrA was characterized from the genomes of both <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, including multiple transcriptional factors such as TetR family regulators, stress gene family protein (MSMEG_3308), and the isoniazid inducible protein IniA (MSMEG_0695). Inhibition of the <italic>mtrA </italic>gene, therefore, resulted in corresponding expression changes in many or all of these target genes in <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).</p>
      <p>In the current study, we found the conserved motifs of the MtrAB two-component system upstream of a large list of genes that have several different functions, including cell cycle progression regulation, secreted antigen, and drug resistance. Interestingly, as shown in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>, there are 42 genes (10%) that were found in both mycobacterial species. MtrA was reported to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of <italic>dnaA </italic>in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>; this provides the first direct evidence of its role in cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In <italic>M. avium</italic>, MtrAB could respond to general stresses and ultimately inhibit cell division [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A recent study found that the promoter for immunodominant secreted antigen 85B was also characterized as the targets of MtrA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Therefore, our findings were consistent with these previous studies.</p>
      <p>Among the many predicted target genes, there are drug resistance and transport-related genes (including the isoniazid inducible gene <italic>iniB</italic>), a probable transport integral membrane gene, and osmoprotection-related genes. The operon <italic>iniBAC </italic>was previously found to confer multidrug tolerance to <italic>M. bovis </italic>BCG through an associated pump-like activity, and was induced by isoniazid and ethambutol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These findings suggest that the <italic>mtrA </italic>gene might be involved in drug resistance. In the current study, we have confirmed that MtrA could bind the <italic>iniB </italic>promoter region. The recombinant <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>strain was found to become sensitive to the anti-TB drugs, isoniazid and streptomycin, when <italic>mtrA </italic>gene expression was inhibited by an antisense mRNA technique (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). In <italic>M. avium</italic>, <italic>mtrAB </italic>was shown to play a role in regulating the composition and permeability of mycobacterial cell walls and was required for morphotypic multidrug resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the current study, the recombinant <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>cells were observed to increase in length. This is most likely due to the changes of the mycobacterial cell wall, which would contribute to mycobacterial sensitivity to anti-TB drugs. All evidence makes MtrA a good target candidate for drug design.</p>

      <title>Conclusions</title>
      <p>The two-component systems of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>are apparently required for its growth and resistance in hostile host environments, in which MtrAB has been reported to regulate the expression of the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>replication initiator gene, <italic>dnaA</italic>. In the current study, we have identified the conserved sites for the recognition of MtrA in the <italic>dnaA </italic>promoter as well as approximately 420 potential target genes. Further <italic>in vivo </italic>studies about a related organism, <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, reveal changes in both cell morphology and drug resistance when MtrA gene expression is inhibited. The data presented here significantly enhance our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of the essential two-component MtrAB system and its role in the drug resistance of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>.</p>
